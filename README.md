# decode|by|anand - YouTube Channel Project

> **Deep dives into India, technology, science, and geopolitics through an intellectually honest Indian lens**

---

## üéØ Vision & Mission

**Vision:** Become India's leading voice for provocative, thoughtful analysis at the intersection of technology, society, science, and geopolitics.

**Mission:** Decode complex phenomena through an Indian perspective‚Äîintellectually honest, conversationally smart, and culturally grounded.

---

## üåü The Big Idea

**decode|by|anand** is a YouTube channel that fills a critical gap in the Indian content ecosystem: **deep, nuanced analysis that challenges conventional thinking while remaining accessible and engaging**.

### Why This Matters

- **Indian Perspective Gap:** Most tech/geopolitics content is Western-centric. We decode the world through Indian eyes.
- **Depth Over Hype:** In an era of 60-second takes, we offer 15-20 minute deep dives that respect audience intelligence.
- **Provocatively Thoughtful:** We ask uncomfortable questions, explore alternative histories, and challenge assumptions respectfully.
- **Culturally Grounded:** Indian examples, context, and philosophy integrated seamlessly‚Äînot as afterthoughts.
