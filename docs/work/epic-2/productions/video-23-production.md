# Video 23 Work: "China’s Belt & Road → India’s Counter Strategy"

## Research & Script Status
- Script: `epic-2/fullscripts/video-23-chinas-bri-to-india-counter.md` — 2,400-word analysis of BRI footprint and India’s response.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `epic-2/research-notes/video-23-bri-counter.md` documenting BRI projects, debt stats, SAGAR/IMEC progress, infrastructure financing data, and partner reactions.
- Validation: Update latest BRI investments (Pakistan, Sri Lanka), IMEC timeline post-2025 G20, Chabahar status, and regional political shifts before recording.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** OBS profile `Decode_IndoPacific`; background world map highlighting BRI corridors with red lines, India’s counter in blue. Frame Obsbot Tiny 2 to the right; leave map on left for callouts.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano cardioid, gain 10 o’clock; high-pass 80 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (-18 dB), limiter -3 dB. Capture room tone.
- **Lighting:** Balanced neutral lighting; subtle blue backlight for strategic tone. White balance 4800K.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva maps (BRI ports, India initiatives), investment bar charts, timeline of key events, playbook checklist. Export to `assets/graphics/video-23/`.
- **B-Roll:** Footage of ports (Gwadar, Hambantota, Chabahar), shipping lanes, diplomatic meetings, ONDC exports. Screen capture BRI Tracker maps, MEA reports. Ensure licensing.

## Recording Plan
1. Rehearse script to maintain clarity on geographic references and data.  
2. Record two VO takes; ensure proper pronunciation (Kyaukphyu, Duqm).  
3. Export WAVs; Audacity noise reduction + slight EQ.  
4. Capture screen walkthroughs of maps and dashboards.  
5. Store assets `/videos/raw/video-23/{voiceover,screen,broll}/`; note timecodes for visual overlays.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- 4K timeline, 25 fps.  
- Utilize animated map overlays showing BRI vs India projects; differentiate colors.  
- Color grade: slight cool contrast to emphasize analytical tone.  
- Audio: Normalize VO to -16 LUFS; bed track “Strategic Drift” (YouTube Audio Library) at -32 LUFS. Insert subtle ocean/wave SFX during maritime segments.  
- Captions: Verify geopolitically sensitive names and abbreviations; export `video-23-bri-counter-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- Geopolitics palette (gold/charcoal).  
- Option A: “BRI vs India” map; Option B: “Who Owns the Indian Ocean?” with port markers.  
- Save PNG to `assets/thumbnails/video-23/`; create 320 × 180 preview.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- TODO metadata `epic-2/metadata/video-23-metadata.md` (keywords: Belt & Road, SAGAR, IMEC, India-China strategy).  
- Upload plan: export master `video-23-bri-counter_4k.mp4` (H.264, 32 Mbps); upload Unlisted Monday 11:00 IST; schedule Monday 18:00 IST. End screen linking to Tariff Wars and Geopolitics playlist.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter/X thread:** maps + key stats, highlight playbook steps, ask “Which project should India fast-track?”  
- **LinkedIn:** strategy recap for policymakers, investors; tag MEA, ports, partner nations.  
- **Instagram carousel:** BRI map, India response, financing callouts, playbook, CTA; Reel with animated map transitions.

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- Monitor geopolitical analysts’ reactions; collect suggestions for follow-up.  
- Track retention at Act 3 to gauge interest in policy playbooks.  
- Log production time and viewer feedback in analytics tracker post launch.
