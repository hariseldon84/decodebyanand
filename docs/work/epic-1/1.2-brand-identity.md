# Story 1.2 Work: Brand Identity System Blueprint

## Logo System
- **Primary Horizontal Mark** – `decode|by|anand` set in Montserrat Bold with custom 40px vertical bars separating each word. Maintain a 1x cap-height padding around the logotype and keep the bars aligned to the baseline and cap height. Use this version for banners, website headers, and wide layouts.  
- **Stacked Mark** – Two-line lockup with `decodeby` on the first line and `anand` on the second, center-aligned inside a circular safe zone. Reserve a minimum safe margin of 12% of the circle diameter. This variation is optimized for profile pictures and app avatars.  
- **Icon Monogram** – Lowercase `d|a` rendered with the same bar motif and set inside a rounded square. Use at 150px+ for watermarks; at smaller sizes drop the bar and use the stylized `d` only.  
- **Clear-Space Rule** – Minimum clear space equals the width of the vertical bar. No text or imagery may enter this zone.  
- **Misuse Guardrails** – Do not stretch, add drop shadows, bevel effects, or change the separator bar thickness. Avoid placing the mark over low-contrast imagery; overlay a 40% indigo scrim if required.

## Color Palette
| Role | Color | Hex | Usage Notes | Contrast Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary 1 | Deep Indigo | `#1A237E` | Backgrounds, headlines, science & philosophy pillar | 13.24:1 vs `#FFFFFF` (passes AA/AAA); 1.01:1 vs `#263238` (fails – avoid indigo text on charcoal) |
| Primary 2 | Electric Cyan | `#00E5FF` | Callouts, tech & society pillar accents | 8.56:1 vs `#263238` (passes AA/AAA); pair with charcoal or indigo, never on white without bold stroke |
| Primary 3 | Saffron | `#FF6D00` | India’s future pillar, highlight bars | 2.82:1 vs `#FFFFFF` (fails); 4.66:1 vs `#263238` (passes AA) |
| Secondary 1 | Dark Charcoal | `#263238` | Body copy on light backgrounds | 7.19:1 vs `#FFFFFF` |
| Secondary 2 | Snow White | `#FFFFFF` | Text on dark backgrounds, negative space | 13.24:1 vs `#1A237E` |
| Accent | Gold | `#FFD700` | Geopolitics pillar accent, infographic highlights | 9.44:1 vs `#1A237E` (passes AA/AAA) |

**Accessibility Adjustments**
- When using Saffron text over white, add a 2px Dark Charcoal outline or place the text on a translucent charcoal panel (`rgba(38,50,56,0.75)`).  
- Electric Cyan on white must include a 2px indigo outline or drop shadow to achieve acceptable contrast.  
- Maintain minimum 18pt font size for accent colors when used over complex imagery.

## Typography System
- **Headline Typeface:** Montserrat Bold / SemiBold. Desktop: 56/64/72 pt scales (ratio 1.2). Thumbnail typography: 96–120 pt uppercase.  
- **Body Typeface:** Inter Regular with 1.5 line height. Recommended sizes – long-form copy 18 pt, captions 16 pt, CTA buttons 20 pt Medium.  
- **Regional Accent Typeface:** Rajdhani Bold for Hindi or Devanagari callouts; pair with Inter for supporting English text.  
- **Pairing Rules:** Never mix more than two typefaces in a frame. Use Montserrat for numbers and stats to maintain geometric rhythm. Apply tracking +20 for uppercase headings.  
- **Licensing & Sources:** All fonts available via Google Fonts (open-source). Include `fonts/README.md` noting download URLs for offline packages.

## Brand Voice & Visual Tone
- **Voice Pillars:** Provocatively thoughtful, intellectually honest, culturally grounded, conversationally smart.  
- **Visual Tone:** Premium yet accessible; minimal gradients; use diagonal motion lines referencing data flow when animating. Prefer photojournalistic imagery over stock smiles.  
- **Texture Library:** Subtle noise overlays at 3% opacity help avoid flat digital surfaces while keeping compression-friendly.

## Asset Production Notes
- **File Naming Convention:** `brand-{element}-{variation}-{size}.{ext}` (e.g., `brand-logo-horizontal-2560.png`).  
- **Export Checklist:** Provide horizontal, stacked, and icon marks at 2560, 1280, 512, 256px (PNG, transparent) plus master SVG files.  
- **Source Files:** Maintain editable artwork in Canva (shared folder `brand-system`) and export layered PDFs to `/assets/branding/brand-system.pdf` for version control.  
- **Delivery Package:** Bundle `/assets/branding/v1/` containing logos, color swatches (exported ASE from Canva), typography specimens, intro/outro assets (Story 1.6), and brand guidelines PDF generated from this document.

## Quick Brand Guidelines (1-Page Snapshot)
1. **Logo Placement:** Anchor bottom-left on thumbnails, center-left on banners, upper-left in lower-thirds. Maintain 5% margin from canvas edge.  
2. **Color Usage:** One dominant pillar color per asset; combine with indigo or charcoal foundations; gold only as accent stripes or data points.  
3. **Typography:** Headlines uppercase Montserrat Bold; supporting copy Inter Regular; citations in Inter Italic 14 pt.  
4. **Imagery:** Promote contrast between warm human subjects and cool abstract backgrounds; add cyan rim glow digitally in Canva or Premiere when physical lighting is limited.  
5. **Motion:** Keep animation ease curves cubic-bezier(.4,0,.2,1); logo reveals in <0.6s; text wipes left-to-right referencing decoding motif.  
6. **Accessibility:** Caption any on-screen text longer than 3 seconds; ensure color contrast >4.5:1; add alt-text descriptions in metadata repository.

## Next Actions
- Produce visual comps in Canva referencing these specifications.  
- Run real-world contrast checks on chosen photography to validate accessibility before upload.  
- Update this document with exported asset links once Story 1.3 files are rendered.
