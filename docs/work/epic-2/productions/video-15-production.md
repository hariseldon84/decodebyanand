# Video 15 Work: "Time Zones as Control Mechanisms"

## Research & Script Status
- Script: `epic-2/fullscripts/video-15-time-zones-control.md` — 2,250-word narrative on chronopolitics and India’s time-zone debate.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `epic-2/research-notes/video-15-time-zones-control.md` to collect studies (CSIR-NIAS, NITI Aayog, ICMR), global case examples (China, Samoa), and updated government statements.
- Validation: Check for latest parliamentary questions or Northeast council resolutions on dual time zones; gather energy consumption updates from Power Ministry prior to recording.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** OBS profile `Decode_TwinClocks`; background with dual clock faces (IST + IST-II). Place Obsbot Tiny 2 slightly right; add overlay slot for timeline graphics.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano cardioid, gain 10 o’clock; filters — high-pass 80 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (-18 dB), limiter -3 dB. Capture room tone.
- **Lighting:** Balanced warm/cool lighting to symbolize dual zones (left warm, right cool); white balance 4900K.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva timeline of global time shifts, India map with sunrise gradient, pilot plan checklist. Export PNGs to `assets/graphics/video-15/`. Prepare animated clock overlay switching between IST and IST-II.
- **B-Roll:** Screen capture worldtimebuddy comparisons, archival photos of railway timetables, footage of early sunrise in Northeast (use stock with attribution), and busy Mumbai nightlife to contrast.

## Recording Plan
1. Rehearse emphasizing storytelling tone in Act 1 and data clarity in Act 2; mark emphasis on pilot steps.  
2. Record two VO takes; ensure correct pronunciations (Chaibagaan, Biswa Bangla).  
3. Export WAVs; Audacity noise reduction, apply slight EQ boost at 3 kHz for articulation.  
4. Capture screen walkthroughs of timelines, daylight charts, proposed API mockups.  
5. Store assets under `/videos/raw/video-15/{voiceover,screen,broll}/`; label clips clearly.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- 4K sequence, 25 fps, 48 kHz audio.  
- Visual motif: split-screen transitions (West/East) using crop + gradient overlay.  
- Color correction: subtle warm tint for IST, cool tint for IST-II segments.  
- Audio: Normalize VO to -16 LUFS; background track “Timekeeper” (YouTube Audio Library) at -30 LUFS, raise during montage. Add ticking clock SFX softly during transitions.  
- Captions: highlight geographic names; export `video-15-time-zones-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- Geopolitics palette (gold/charcoal) with dual clock imagery.  
- Option A: “Who Owns Time?”; Option B: “IST vs IST-II?”.  
- Save PNG to `assets/thumbnails/video-15/` + 320 × 180 preview.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- TODO metadata `epic-2/metadata/video-15-metadata.md` (include keywords “India dual time zone”, “chronopolitics”, “Northeast daylight”).  
- Upload plan: export master `video-15-time-zones_4k.mp4` (H.264, 32 Mbps); upload Unlisted Monday 12:00 IST; schedule Monday 18:00 IST. End screen linking to Tariff Wars episode and Geopolitics playlist.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter/X:** Thread with 4 cards (global example, India energy stat, health impact, pilot plan) + poll “Should India test a second time zone?”  
- **LinkedIn:** Focus on productivity, energy savings, and governance; tag NE Council, Power Ministry, NITI Aayog.  
- **Instagram carousel:** sunrise vs skyline visuals, data snippets, action plan; Reel snippet showing dual clock overlay.

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- Track viewer responses from Northeast; gather qualitative feedback for potential follow-up.  
- Analytics: watch retention around policy recommendations (Act 3) and note if dual-tone visual cue aids engagement.  
- Update analytics log with production hours and viewer sentiment tags once live.
