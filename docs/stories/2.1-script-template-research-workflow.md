---

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Script length calculator documented:
   - Target word count: 2,100-2,800 words (15-20 min at 140 WPM speaking pace)

### Research Workflow Requirements

**Source Evaluation Criteria:**

2. **Bias:** Perspective identification, conflicts of interest, funding sources
3. **Recency:** Publication date, data currency, context relevance

**Note-Taking System:**
- Platform: Notion or Markdown files in repository
- Organization: One folder/page per video topic
- Format: Source metadata + notes + key quotes + personal analysis

**Citation Format:**
```
Author Name (Year). "Title." Publication Name. URL. Date Accessed.

Example:
Sharma, Rajesh (2024). "India's Semiconductor Ambitions." Economic Times.
https://economictimes.com/article. Accessed: 2025-01-15.
```

**Fact-Checking Process:**
- 3+ source rule: All statistics must be verified across 3+ credible sources
- Cross-reference with official data (government reports, research papers)
- Document conflicting information and present multiple perspectives
- Flag speculative claims with appropriate disclaimers

### Brand Voice Guidelines

**4 Core Voice Principles:**

**1. Intellectually Honest**
- No hype or exaggeration
- Acknowledge uncertainty and nuance
- Present multiple perspectives on controversial topics
- Admit when evidence is limited or conflicting
- Avoid sensationalism for clicks

**2. Conversationally Smart**
- Accessible language (not academic-sterile)
- Explain jargon when necessary
- Engage audience with rhetorical questions
- Balance depth with clarity
- Sound like a thoughtful conversation, not a lecture

**3. Provocatively Thoughtful**
- Challenge conventional assumptions
- Pose "what if" scenarios
- Encourage critical thinking
- Take unexpected angles on familiar topics
- Make audience question their beliefs (respectfully)

**4. Culturally Grounded**
- Integrate Indian perspective and context
- Use Indian examples and case studies
- Reference Indian history, culture, philosophy when relevant
- Avoid Western-centric assumptions
- Speak from Indian experience, not as outsider
