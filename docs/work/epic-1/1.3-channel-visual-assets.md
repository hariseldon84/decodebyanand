# Story 1.3 Work: Channel Visual Assets Plan

## Banner Concept (2560 × 1440 px)
- **Safe Area Layout (1546 × 423 px):**  
  - Left 40%: Stacked logo (white on 80% indigo overlay).  
  - Center 40%: Tagline “Decode complex phenomena through an Indian lens” set in Montserrat Semibold 64 pt, cyan underline aligned to baseline.  
  - Right 20%: Publishing cadence badge (`Mon • Wed • Fri · 6 PM IST`) in Inter Medium 28 pt, saffron pill background with charcoal text.  
- **Background Treatment:** Radial gradient `#1A237E` (center) → `#0B132B` (edges) with diagonal cyan grid lines at 10% opacity and saffron spark particles near tagline.  
- **Imagery Strip:** 320 px-high photo collage along bottom edge featuring technology, policy, and science visuals blurred to 20% to maintain focus on text.  
- **Action Buttons Guide:** Reserve 320 px from bottom-right edge free of visual noise to keep subscribe button legible on TV.  
- **Export Notes:** Deliver full 2560 × 1440 PNG and a preview showing safe area overlay for quick QA.

### Narrative & Variations
- Treat the banner as the channel’s “mission board”: left side houses identity, middle spells out promise, right side signals cadence so new visitors know when to return.  
- Keep the background collage abstracted (blur 20–30%) so the text remains dominant; rotate imagery quarterly to match active pillars (e.g., satellites for space series, macro maps for geopolitics).  
- Maintain consistent logo and tagline placement across iterations; only swap the cadence badge if schedule changes.  
- When launching special series, swap the center tagline for a limited-time message (≤30 days) but preserve typography, color, and safe-area discipline.

## Profile Picture (2048 × 2048 px Master)
- Use stacked logo variant centered with 15% padding.  
- Background: Saffron-to-Indigo angular gradient (`#FF6D00` at 45°, `#1A237E` at 225°) with subtle cyan rim light around the circle edge.  
- Apply 4% inner shadow in charcoal to create depth when scaled to 98 px.  
- Export sizes: 2048, 1024, 512, 256, 128 px PNG; test legibility at 40 px (comment avatar size).

## Watermark Icon (150 × 150 px)
- Base on `d|a` monogram; fill white, overlay 30% cyan stroke.  
- Add drop shadow (`0,0,8`, 25% opacity) for clarity over dark footage.  
- Provide two variants: full opacity (for high-contrast footage) and 70% opacity (for bright daylight footage).  
- Configure placement bottom-right with 12 px safe margin when uploaded to YouTube Studio; set display to “Entire video”.

## Device Testing Checklist
1. **Desktop:** Use YouTube banner preview to confirm tagline and cadence badge remain within safe area; ensure collage not distracting at 24″ monitor.  
2. **Mobile:** Confirm only logo + tagline visible; reposition if cadence badge intrudes beyond 40 px from top.  
3. **Tablet:** Validate gradients remain smooth (use Canva “PNG high quality” export and add subtle noise overlay if banding appears).  
4. **TV:** View from 10 ft; increase tagline size by 8 pt if readability suffers.  
5. **Dark Mode Browser:** Check that cyan grid lines do not cause moiré patterns.

## Source File Organization
- Build designs in Canva and duplicate into a shared folder named `decodebyanand-branding`.  
- Export layered backups as PDF Print and PNG assets into `assets/branding/` with subfolders `banner/`, `profile/`, `watermark/`.  
- Document hex values and typography settings in `assets/branding/README.md` for quick handoff.

## Upload Procedure Notes
- Sequence the uploads in YouTube Studio: `Customization → Branding → Profile Picture → Banner Image → Video Watermark`.  
- After uploading, capture screenshots of each device preview and archive in `docs/work/epic-1/channel-visual-assets-preview.pdf`.  
- Schedule quarterly refresh to evolve imagery while maintaining layout consistency.
