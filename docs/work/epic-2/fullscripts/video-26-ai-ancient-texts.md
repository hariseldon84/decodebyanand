## Opening Hook (0:00-0:30) | ~70 words
Palm-leaf manuscripts fading, Vedic meters complex, Indus script undeciphered—can AI revive what time erased? Tonight we explore how machine learning, OCR, NLP, and knowledge graphs are bringing ancient Indian texts back to life—and the guardrails needed to respect context and culture.

## Introduction (0:30-1:30) | ~210 words
India houses millions of manuscripts in Sanskrit, Pali, Tamil, Persian, and more—many crumbling on library shelves. Translating, annotating, contextualising them is labour-intensive. AI now helps: scanning, digitizing, deciphering scripts, generating translations, even reconstructing missing fragments. Projects at IITs, IIIT-H, BORI, Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, and global collaborators harness neural networks. But AI misreads nuance; hallucinations can distort heritage. We must blend tech with scholarship.

Act 1 showcases AI breakthroughs in ancient text digitisation. Act 2 weighs risks—accuracy, bias, ownership. Act 3 outlines India’s roadmap for ethical, large-scale cultural preservation with AI.

## Act 1 – Tech Revives Texts (1:30-6:00) | ~780 words
### Digitisation & OCR
- National Mission for Manuscripts digitised 3.1 million pages; AI-based OCR (Tesseract Sanskrit, IIIT-H Indic OCR) accelerates scanning {S1}.  
- IIT Kharagpur’s OCR for Indic scripts handles Devanagari, Bangla, Tamil with >95% accuracy after retraining.  
- Tirumala’s digitisation uses AI to stitch fragile palm-leaf images.

### Script Decipherment
- Indus script research uses pattern recognition to analyze symbol sequences; unsolved but AI reveals probabilities {S2}.  
- Brahmi, Grantha, Sharada OCR projects by SANSKRITi-AI, BORI to decode inscriptions.

### Language Models & Translation
- AI4Bharat’s IndicTrans2 translates Sanskrit, Pali, Tamil into English and modern Indian languages.  
- Google’s Project Vaani partners with IISc for speech corpora capturing dialects.  
- Generative models on Manuscript-to-Modern (M2M) pipeline summarise and cross-reference commentaries.
 
### Knowledge Graphs
- Sāmagrī (IITB) builds graph linking words, concepts, persons across scriptures.  
- Digital Corpus of Sanskrit (Brown University) leverages AI for morphological analysis.  
- Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS) division integrates AI with Ayurveda, astronomy texts.

### Restoration & Reconstruction
- Neural networks fill missing lines using context (e.g., Mahabharata manuscripts).  
- AI identifies scribal errors, variant readings, enabling critical editions.

## Act 2 – Risks & Challenges (6:00-11:00) | ~750 words
### Accuracy & Interpretation
- OCR/translation errors propagate misinterpretation. AI lacks cultural context; idioms and philosophy misrendered.  
- Scholars warn against blind trust—AI suggests but cannot replace philological expertise.

### Bias & Hallucination
- Language models trained on modern corpora inject present-day bias; may generate inauthentic verses.  
- AI summarization might oversimplify complex metaphysics.

### Data Ownership & Access
- Manuscripts often privately held by families/temples; digitisation raises questions of rights, attribution, commercialization.  
- Communities fear appropriation or misrepresentation of sacred texts.

### Ethical Use
- Sensitive information (esoteric rituals) may be misused.  
- Need guidelines to respect religious sentiments, indigenous knowledge IP.

### Technical Gaps
- Low-resource scripts (Modi, Gurumukhi variants) underrepresented.  
- Handwritten variability requires large annotated datasets; manual effort still high.  
- Storage, metadata curation, long-term preservation challenges.

### Capacity Building
- Lack of digital humanities training in India; few programs bridging AI and classical studies.  
- Funding sporadic; sustained support needed.

## Act 3 – India’s AI Heritage Blueprint (11:00-16:00) | ~780 words
### 1. National Manuscript Cloud
Create “Bharat Heritage Cloud” hosting high-resolution scans, OCR text, metadata under open licenses with cultural safeguards. Ensure redundancy and offline storage.

### 2. Scholar-AI Collaboration
Establish AI + Indology labs at IITs/universities; fund fellowships for scholars and engineers to co-develop tools. Include training on textual criticism, ethics.

### 3. Benchmark Datasets
Release annotated corpora for diverse scripts using open standards. Encourage community contributions with version control. Provide challenge grants for Indus script, Modi script OCR.

### 4. Cultural Governance
Set up Heritage Data Council including scholars, community leaders, technologists to approve digitisation, manage permissions, handle sensitive material.

### 5. Explainable AI
Use models that provide context, sources, confidence scores. Provide side-by-side human translations. Mandate human review for published outputs.

### 6. Community Access & Education
Develop apps for schools, researchers, diaspora to explore texts. Integrate with Bharatiya Bhasha Mission, Indian Knowledge Systems curriculum.

### 7. Preservation & Funding
Allocate ₹5,000 crore over decade for digitisation, infrastructure, scholarships. Create Heritage Innovation Fund to support startups building tools; encourage CSR contributions.

### 8. International Partnerships
Collaborate with global libraries (British Library, Vatican) for joint projects; ensure repatriation of digital copies. Use UNESCO frameworks.

### 9. Intellectual Property & Benefit Sharing
Recognise community custodianship; share royalties/credits where monetisation occurs. Use creative commons or culturally appropriate licensing.

### 10. AI Guardrails
Publish guidelines for generative AI on ancient texts—disclose synthetic content, avoid claims of authenticity, require peer review.

## Conclusion (16:00-17:15) | ~210 words
AI can resurrect India’s textual heritage—but only with rigour, ethics, and collaboration. Algorithms accelerate transcription and translation, yet scholars anchor meaning. The mission is not just digitisation, but democratized access rooted in respect. By pairing AI with cultural stewardship, India can safeguard millennia-old wisdom for future generations.
