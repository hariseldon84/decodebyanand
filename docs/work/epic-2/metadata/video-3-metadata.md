India as the Center of Human History? Myth vs Evidence

## Description (≈240 words)
**Can India’s epics, archaeological digs, and genetic studies align to prove this land is humanity’s central story? Or do we risk twisting mythology into pseudo-history?**  

In this episode I juxtapose excavation reports from Rakhigarhi, marine studies off Dwarka, genetic research on Indo-European migrations, and cultural narratives passed down through the Mahabharata and Puranas. You’ll hear three perspectives—civilizational pride, academic caution, and a synthesis lens—each with strengths and blind spots. A clear disclaimer runs throughout: speculation is flagged, multiple views are welcomed, and respectful debate is expected.
