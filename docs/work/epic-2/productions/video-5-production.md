# Video 5 Work: "Is Technology Making Us Dumber?"

## Research & Script Status
- Script: `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/fullscripts/video-5-technology-makes-us-dumber.md` — 2,350-word draft covering cognitive science studies and Indian digital discipline framework.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/research-notes/video-5-technology-makes-us-dumber.md` capturing Indian sources (NIMHANS, Infosys whitepaper, Mindful Schools pilot) and latest screen-time statistics.
- Validation: Reconfirm Microsoft attention span data (S2) and TRAI smartphone usage (S10) with 2025 figures prior to shoot.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** OBS profile `Decode_Cyan`; add productivity-themed backdrop (bookshelf slide). Frame Obsbot Tiny 2 eye-level, moderate auto-framing.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano cardioid, gain 10 o’clock; filters—high-pass 80 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (threshold -18 dB), limiter -3 dB. Capture room tone.
- **Lighting:** Warm key light (desk lamp bounced) plus cool fill from monitor to represent tech glow; set OBS white balance 4800K.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva slides for cognitive studies, attention span graphs, Digital Dharma habits list. Export PNGs to `assets/graphics/video-5/`. Prepare lower third callouts for habits.
- **B-Roll:** Record iPhone footage of scrolling montage, analog note-taking, focus rituals (Pomodoro timer). Screen capture of productivity apps (Forest, Notion focus board). Log shot list.

## Recording Plan
1. Rehearse script focusing on transitions between downsides and solutions to maintain balanced tone.  
2. Record two VO takes in OBS; note emphasis on stats (Acts 1 & 2).  
3. Export WAVs, run Audacity noise reduction + gentle EQ (cut 200 Hz muddiness).  
4. Capture screen demos of Canva slides and app walkthroughs.  
5. Store assets under `/videos/raw/video-5/` with subfolders; update tracker.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- Timeline 3840 × 2160, 25 fps, 48 kHz audio.  
- Sequence structure: Hook montage (smartphone B-roll), Act 1 (downsides), Act 2 (solutions), Act 3 (Indian blueprint).  
- Color correction: brighten analog shots (Exposure +0.3), add slight vignette for deep work segments.  
- Audio: Normalize VO to -16 LUFS; bed music “Deep Focus” (YouTube Audio Library) at -30 LUFS, raise to -24 LUFS during Act 3 action plan.  
- Graphics: Insert stat overlays using Essential Graphics template; animate “Digital Sabbath” bullet list with wipe transitions.  
- Captions: Generate auto transcripts; ensure acronyms (NIMHANS, PUE) spelled correctly. Export SRT `video-5-tech-dumber-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- Pillar template: Tech & Society cyan palette.  
- Option A text: “Digital Brain Drain”; Option B: “Is Tech Shrinking Us?”  
- Subject: side-by-side collage (phone glow vs notebook); Canva glow effect on phone, saffron accent for Indian solution.  
- Save PNG (<2 MB) to `/assets/thumbnails/video-5/` + 320 × 180 preview.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- TODO metadata file `docs/work/epic-2/metadata/video-5-metadata.md` with keywords “digital burnout India”, “NIMHANS screen time”, “deep work rituals”.  
- Upload workflow: export master `video-5-tech-dumber_4k.mp4` (H.264, 32 Mbps); upload Unlisted Wednesday 11:00 IST; attach captions, Option A thumbnail; schedule Wednesday 18:00 IST. Configure end screen linking to Video 4 (simulation) and Tech & Society playlist.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter/X:** Thread contrasting downsides vs solutions; include poll “How many hours on phone yesterday?”  
- **LinkedIn:** Emphasise workplace deep work zones; tag TCS, Infosys, NASSCOM.  
- **Instagram carousel:** 4 slides (stat, symptom, solution, habit checklist). Reel snippet on “Anushasan Block” ritual.

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- Track viewer comments for additional focus hacks; compile for follow-up community post.  
- Analytics: compare retention drop between Act 1 negativity and Act 3 solutions; monitor CTR vs Video 4 because of similar audience.  
- Document testimonials for potential newsletter feature on digital discipline.
