# Video 8 Work: "From Privacy to Surveillance: Aadhaar’s Tightrope"

## Research & Script Status
- Script: `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/fullscripts/video-8-privacy-to-surveillance-aadhaar.md` — 2,450-word analysis with policy recommendations.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/research-notes/video-8-privacy-to-surveillance-aadhaar.md` compiling legal texts (Puttaswamy, 2019 amendment, DPDP Act), UIDAI metrics, breach case studies, and global comparisons (Estonia, Kenya).
- Updates: Verify latest UIDAI enrollment numbers, DBT savings, and any new Supreme Court/Parliament developments before recording.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** OBS profile `Decode_Charcoal`; backdrop: blurred Aadhaar card with lock icon overlay. Frame Obsbot Tiny 2 centrally; maintain serious tone.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano cardioid, gain ~10 o’clock; high-pass 90 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (-20 dB), limiter -3 dB. Capture room tone.
- **Lighting:** Neutral key light, avoid harsh shadows; set white balance 4800K to keep neutral look.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva slides for Aadhaar timeline, risk matrix, Digital Dharma pillars. Export to `assets/graphics/video-8/`. Prepare masked e-Aadhaar overlay for demonstration.
- **B-Roll:** Screen capture UIDAI dashboard, Aadhaar app, news articles on breaches; film manual Aadhaar masking technique (covering digits) via iPhone. Document sources for fact-check.

## Recording Plan
1. Rehearse focusing on empathetic tone when discussing exclusion incidents.  
2. Record two VO takes; ensure legal references enunciated clearly.  
3. Export WAVs; Audacity noise reduction + light de-esser.  
4. Capture screen walkthroughs of critical documents (Puttaswamy summary, DPDP highlights).  
5. Store assets in `/videos/raw/video-8/{voiceover,screen,broll}/`.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- Sequence 3840 × 2160, 25 fps.  
- Include on-screen ticker listing legal cases when referenced.  
- Color: apply mild desaturation (Contrast +5, Saturation -6) for investigative tone.  
- Audio: Normalize to -16 LUFS; bed music “Neutral Documentary” at -30 LUFS. Add subtle heartbeat effect during surveillance risk segment, fade gently.  
- Captions: Add clarifications for acronyms (DPDP, UIDAI). Export `video-8-aadhaar-surveillance-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- Geopolitics & Economics template (gold accent).  
- Option A text: “Aadhaar: Safety or Surveillance?” with split face + biometric scan.  
- Option B: “India’s Digital Tightrope.”  
- Save to `/assets/thumbnails/video-8/`; include mobile preview.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- Draft metadata `docs/work/epic-2/metadata/video-8-metadata.md` (todo) emphasising keywords “Aadhaar privacy”, “Digital Dharma”, “DPDP Act 2023”.  
- Upload: export master `video-8-aadhaar-tightrope_4k.mp4` (H.264, 35 Mbps); upload Unlisted Wednesday 12:00 IST; schedule Wednesday 18:00 IST. End screen linking to privacy playlist and secret societies episode.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter/X:** Thread summarizing five Digital Dharma pillars; include poll “How comfortable sharing Aadhaar digitally?”  
- **LinkedIn:** Focus on governance recommendations; tag UIDAI, MeitY, India Stack leaders.  
- **Instagram Stories:** 3 slides (hook, risk, solution) with swipe-up link/“link in bio”; include tip on using masked Aadhaar copies.

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- Prepare legal citations to reply to queries; direct critics to research note.  
- Track in analytics whether sensitive topic impacts watch time compared to neutral tech videos.  
- Log viewer suggestions for future privacy-focused content (possible follow-up on DigiLocker or MOSIP).
