## Opening Hook (0:00-0:30) | ~70 words
When Apple locks an iPhone, governments negotiate. When Meta tweaks feed algorithms, elections shift. When Google deploys passkeys, banks follow. Tech giants control infrastructure that once belonged to states—identity, communication, finance, intelligence. Tonight we decode the power shift: from nation states to tech corporations, the battle for governance, and how India should reclaim digital sovereignty without stifling innovation.

## Introduction (0:30-1:30) | ~220 words
States mint currency, run courts, and secure borders. Tech companies run payment rails, set speech norms, and manage data. India navigates this tension daily—digital taxes on Big Tech, data localization for Aadhaar, ONDC challenging platform monopolies. Globally, the EU wields regulation, the US tussles with antitrust, China builds state-controlled tech. Who governs whom?

Act 1 maps the spheres where tech companies rival nation states—identity, finance, security, governance. Act 2 dissects flashpoints in India and worldwide. Act 3 presents India’s strategic toolkit: regulation, public infrastructure, partnerships. Because the future citizen toggles between passports and platform accounts.

## Act 1 – Domains of Control (1:30-6:00) | ~780 words
### Identity & Authentication
Apple, Google, Meta offer single sign-on controlling access to services. FIDO passkeys shift authentication power to device makers. Mastercard/Visa run tokenization. Aadhaar counters with state-backed ID, yet private platforms remain gatekeepers for daily logins.

### Communications & Narrative
Meta, X, YouTube govern speech via moderation policies, shaping public discourse. Their algorithms determine news reach. Governments rely on them for announcements, disaster messaging.

### Payments & Commerce
Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, Stripe, Visa network handle global transactions. In India, UPI (state-backed) counters, but FinTech giants still mediate credit, lending, BNPL. Amazon and Flipkart run commerce ecosystems akin to trade ministries controlling supply chains.

### Infrastructure & Cloud
AWS, Azure, Google Cloud host government data, startups, banks. Outages affect national services. Their global footprint dwarfs many national data centers.

### Intelligence & Surveillance
Tech companies hold granular behavioural data; law enforcement depends on them. Data requests, lawful interception, encryption battles highlight control contest.

### AI & Standards
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google influence global AI safety norms. Open-source communities (Meta, Stability) set technical standards. Governments scramble to catch up.

## Act 2 – Flashpoints (6:00-11:00) | ~780 words
### India vs Big Tech
- **Data Localization:** RBI mandated payments data residence; global firms complied after lobbying. MeitY pushing for broader localization.  
- **Digital Tax (Equalisation Levy):** Targets digital ad revenues; led to US tariff threats.  
- **WhatsApp Traceability:** Government demands traceability for harmful content; WhatsApp resists citing privacy.  
- **Apple vs CCI:** Investigations into App Store policies; app developers push for ONDC integration.  
- **X Government Orders:** Takedown notices, non-compliance fines.  
- **Google vs Competition Commission:** Android dominance penalties; alternative app store requirements.

### Global Precedents
- **EU Digital Services/Markets Acts (DSA/DMA):** Force algorithm transparency, sideloading, interoperability.  
- **US Antitrust:** DOJ vs Google, FTC vs Amazon.  
- **China:** Tech crackdown to reassert state control; data security law, restrictions on gaming/time for minors.  
- **Russia:** Local data storage laws; platform bans.

### Corporate Responses
Big Tech invests in lobbying, local partnerships, data centers, and compliance teams. They may threaten service withdrawal (e.g., Meta in Canada news law). They also provide critical disaster support (cloud credits, AI tools).

## Act 3 – India’s Strategy (11:00-16:00) | ~780 words
### 1. Build Public Digital Infrastructure
ONDC, UPI, Account Aggregator, DigiLocker show India’s capability. Expand with ONDC 2.0 (logistics, media), Open Network for Cloud (localized hosting). Use DPI to avoid lock-in.

### 2. Smart Regulation
Craft Digital India Act with risk-tiered approach: essential platform obligations (transparency, interoperability), algorithm audits, grievance redress. Align with global best practices but tailored to Indian context.

### 3. Data Governance
Operationalize DPDP Act via Data Protection Board; ensure data consent managers interoperable. Promote data trusts for public interest research while protecting privacy.

### 4. Competition & Interoperability
Enforce CCI directives to prevent gatekeeper abuse; support alternative app stores. Encourage open standards, API interoperability to reduce dependence on single providers.

### 5. Strategic Partnerships
Negotiate with tech giants for localization, R&D, job creation; maintain diplomatic engagement. Leverage India’s market size to secure fair terms (pricing, compliance).

### 6. Sovereign Cloud & Cybersecurity
Develop national cloud framework (MeghRaj 2.0) with private participation; ensure critical workloads can move off foreign clouds if needed. Invest in cybersecurity response teams.

### 7. Digital Diplomacy
Lead Global South coalition on digital rights. Use G20, WTO, QUAD to set tech governance norms. Collaborate with EU/US on AI, with ASEAN/Africa on DPI exports.

### 8. Citizen Empowerment
Improve digital literacy; ensure users understand rights, controls. Support civil society oversight of both state and corporate power.

### 9. Innovation Ecosystem
Support domestic tech champions through grants, procurement, sandboxes. Encourage ethical AI startups, open-source communities.

### 10. Crisis Protocols
Establish contingency plans if platforms withdraw services—backup messaging (Sandes app), payment systems, emergency broadcast.

## Conclusion (16:00-17:15) | ~210 words
Tech corporations now share power with nation states. Rather than choose sides, India must craft a balanced digital sovereignty strategy—leveraging public infrastructure, smart regulation, partnerships, and empowered citizens. The goal isn’t to crush innovation, but to ensure democratic accountability. The passport and the platform account should both serve the people.
