# Story 2.3 Work: Video 2 – "UPI Revolution"

## Research & Script Assets
- Research log: `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/research-notes/video-2-upi-revolution.md` (10 sources spanning NPCI, RBI, World Bank, IMF, BIS, The Ken).
- Script draft: `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/fullscripts/video-2-upi-revolution.md` — 2,245 words covering JAM origins, incentive design, and future risks with `{U#}` citations tied to research log.
- Metadata package: `docs/work/epic-2/metadata/video-2-metadata.md` including SEO title, 240-word description, 20 tags, and pin comment prompt.

## Efficiency Targets
- Carry forward edit template from Video 1 to cut assembly time by reusing Premiere sequence, lower-third graphics, and audio chain.
- Prepare Canva slides and OBS screen captures in a single afternoon; reuse bar/timeline assets from Video 1 with updated color palette (Tech & Society cyan dominant).
- Recording block scheduled for 4 hours vs 6 in Video 1: 45 minutes rehearsal, 90 minutes for dual VO takes, 45 minutes for screen capture and B-roll, 30 minutes buffer.

## Pre-Production Updates
- OBS scene duplication: clone `Decode_A_Roll` to `Decode_A_Roll_UPI` with cyan frame accent and lower-third referencing “Tech & Society”.
- Audio workflow identical to Video 1; add -6 dB safety limiter to music bed track in template sequence for faster mixing.
- Visual kit: Canva to produce timeline, cost comparison chart, and smartphone adoption graph; export as transparent PNGs for overlay. Capture NPCI dashboard using OBS window capture with 70 percent opacity blur to mask personally identifiable data.

## Recording & Editing Notes
- Voiceover emphasis on data sections (Act 1 timeline, Act 2 zero MDR) — mark inflection points in script for measured delivery; maintain 110 WPM average to match target runtime.
- B-roll: iPhone 15 footage of local merchant scanning QR, screen recording of UPI payment flow, and macro shots of QR stickers. Stabilize in Premiere with Warp Stabilizer (10%) and add subtle film grain overlay from Canva asset pack.
- Apply intro/outro from Story 1.6; update pillar label to cyan variant. Insert watermark at 30 seconds. Integrate on-screen callout for “Zero MDR” at 08:15 to reinforce key insight.
- Captions generated via Premiere Speech to Text; export SRT `video-2-upi-revolution.srt`.

## Thumbnail Plan
- Template: Tech & Society cyan gradient with charcoal contrast.
- Option A headline: “UPI Rules the World”  
- Option B headline: “QR Codes > Credit Cards?”  
- Subject: frame from Obsbot recording (mid-shot) with cyan digital grid overlay; apply Canva glow + charcoal drop shadow. Export PNG (1280 × 720) and 320 × 180 preview for readability check.

## Publishing Workflow
- Upload master `video-2-upi-revolution_4k.mp4` (H.264, 35 Mbps) by Tuesday 12:00 IST. Schedule for Wednesday 18:00 IST.
- End screen: Subscribe (left), Latest video (center), Tech & Society playlist (right).
- Cards:  
  - 04:10 link to Video 1 (hard tech gap).  
  - 09:30 link to ONDC explainer (when available).  
  - 13:20 link to playlist “India’s Digital State”.
- A/B test thumbnails manually if CTR <4% after 24 hours.

## Performance Comparison Plan
- Log production hours in tracker (research, scripting, recording, editing) — target ≤22 hours total, ideally 20.  
- After publish +48h, capture analytics (CTR, average view duration, subscribers gained) and compare to Video 1; store in `/analytics/video-1-vs-video-2.md` when created in Story 2.6.  
- Note audience retention drop-offs; adjust pacing in future scripts.

## Cross-Post Copy
- **Twitter/X thread:** 5-tweet sequence highlighting adoption stats, zero MDR debate, future outlook; include infographic snippet and poll on next UPI feature viewers want.  
- **LinkedIn:** Story-driven post on how UPI lowered transaction friction for MSMEs; tag NPCI, RBI, digital payments leaders.  
- **Instagram:** Carousel of 3 slides (timeline, cost comparison, key insight) plus 15-sec reel using Act 3 voiceover clip with captions.
