# Video 17 Work: "If the Caste System Disappeared Overnight"

## Research & Script Status
- Script: `epic-2/fullscripts/video-17-caste-system-eliminated-overnight.md` — 2,400-word scenario analysis of abrupt caste abolition.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `epic-2/research-notes/video-17-caste-abolition-scenario.md` compiling legal precedents (reservation acts, SC judgments), socio-economic studies, and expert opinions to validate assumptions.
- Validation: Revisit latest reservation data, diversity stats, and ongoing litigation to ensure scenario reflects current context before recording.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** OBS profile `Decode_WhatIf`; background gradient transitioning from grayscale (past) to vibrant (future). Position Obsbot Tiny 2 center-left for overlay of scenario steps.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano cardioid, gain 10 o’clock; filters — high-pass 80 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (-18 dB), limiter -3 dB. Capture room tone.
- **Lighting:** Mix cool and warm lighting to symbolize tension between abolishing and rebuilding; white balance 4800K.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva slides illustrating scenario timeline, fallout matrix, transition roadmap. Create animated infographic for equity index and reparations toolkit. Export to `assets/graphics/video-17/`.
- **B-Roll:** Screen capture relevant laws (Constitution Articles 15(4), 17, 46), footage of classrooms, government offices, activism. Include stock footage showing inter-caste community building. Log copyright info.

## Recording Plan
1. Rehearse narrative with empathetic tone; ensure disclaimers emphasise thought experiment nature.  
2. Record two VO takes; monitor emphasis on words like “reparation,” “affirmative action.”  
3. Export WAVs; apply Audacity noise reduction + gentle multiband compression.  
4. Screen record scenario diagrams and roadmap steps.  
5. Store assets `/videos/raw/video-17/{voiceover,screen,broll}/` with timeline notes for editor.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- 4K timeline, 25 fps.  
- Opening montage: quick cuts of news tickers, courts, campuses; use glitch effect transitioning into scenario description.  
- Color grade: start monochrome in Act 1, gradually introduce saturation by Act 3.  
- Audio: Normalize VO to -16 LUFS; bed track “Contemplative Future” (YouTube Audio Library) at -32 LUFS; add subtle heartbeat SFX when discussing fallout.  
- Captions: Ensure legal terms spelled correctly; export `video-17-caste-abolition-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- India’s Future palette with half-toned question mark overlay.  
- Option A: “What If Caste Vanished?”; Option B: “Life After Caste?”.  
- Save PNG to `assets/thumbnails/video-17/`; create 320 × 180 preview.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- TODO metadata `epic-2/metadata/video-17-metadata.md` with SEO keywords (“caste abolition scenario”, “reservations future”, “equity transition”).  
- Upload plan: export master `video-17-caste-abolition_4k.mp4` (H.264, 32 Mbps); upload Unlisted Friday 11:00 IST; schedule Friday 18:00 IST. End screen linking to Caste’s Invisible Walls episode and India’s Future playlist.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter/X:** Thread summarizing scenario, fallout, and roadmap; invite viewers to discuss essential safeguards.  
- **LinkedIn:** Policy-oriented post encouraging debate among policymakers, activists, legal scholars.  
- **Instagram carousel:** Step-by-step visuals; include poll “What must exist before caste labels disappear?”

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- Closely moderate comments—topic is sensitive. Refer to moderation plan (Story 1.3) for escalation.  
- Collect expert responses for possible panel discussion or follow-up live stream.  
- Analytics: track retention at scenario vs roadmap segments to refine future thought-experiments.
