## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Content Production Workflow:**
Trailer follows standard production pipeline: Script → Record → Edit → Publish
[Source: architecture.md#3.1-content-production-workflow]

### Script Requirements

**Structure:**
- Hook (0:00-0:10): Provocative question or statement
- Value Proposition (0:10-0:40): What makes decodebyanand unique
- Call-to-Action (0:40-0:60): Subscribe for weekly deep dives
[Source: prd-section-5-epics-stories.md#story-1.4]

**Brand Voice:**
- Intellectually Honest → Clear, uncluttered messaging
- Conversationally Smart → Approachable, not academic-sterile
- Provocatively Thoughtful → Bold, unexpected perspectives
- Culturally Grounded → Indian context integrated thoughtfully

[Source: architecture.md#5.1-core-production-tools, architecture.md#6.3-production-qa]

**Recording Workflow:**
1. Mic check and test recording (first 30 seconds)
2. Record 2-3 full takes
3. Clean up audio: Remove background noise, normalize levels
