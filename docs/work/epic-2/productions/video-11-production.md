# Video 11 Work: "How Secret Coordination Works in the Digital Age"

## Research & Script Status
- Script: `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/fullscripts/video-11-digital-age-secret-coordination.md` — 2,250-word guide to encrypted organizing with Indian case studies.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/research-notes/video-11-digital-age-secret-coordination.md` to document tool comparisons (Signal, SimpleX, Bridgefy), Indian protest tech stacks, and legal frameworks (IT Act, UAPA, FCRA).
- Validation: Update internet shutdown statistics and latest platform policy changes (WhatsApp traceability, Signal features) before release.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** OBS profile `Decode_DarkMode`; background of network nodes forming/vanishing. Frame Obsbot Tiny 2 mid shot; keep minimalistic aesthetic.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano cardioid, gain 10 o’clock; filters—high-pass 90 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (-20 dB), limiter -3 dB for crisp clarity.
- **Lighting:** Low-key lighting with single key and backlight for dramatic tech vibe; set white balance 4600K.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva diagrams of E2EE workflow, metadata minimisation, mesh network flowchart. Export to `assets/graphics/video-11/`. Prepare tool comparison table overlay.
- **B-Roll:** Screen record Signal disappearing message settings, SimpleX interface, Bridgefy demo. Capture B-roll of turning off phone biometrics, using Faraday pouch, hardware keys.

## Recording Plan
1. Rehearse emphasising responsible usage disclaimers and legal awareness.  
2. Record two VO takes; keep pace brisk but clear for tool explanations.  
3. Export WAVs; Audacity noise reduction + limiter for consistent dynamics.  
4. Capture screen walkthroughs demonstrating security settings.  
5. Store assets `/videos/raw/video-11/{voiceover,screen,broll}/`.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- 4K sequence, 25 fps.  
- Use glitch transitions to highlight key tool sections; overlay matrix code effect sparingly.  
- Color grading: cool contrast (Contrast +8, Highlights -5).  
- Audio: Normalize to -16 LUFS; ambient bed “Future Pulse” at -30 LUFS; insert notification SFX when discussing risks to illustrate.  
- Captions: Spell out tool names and acronyms; export `video-11-secret-coordination-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- Geopolitics & Economics template with dark overlay.  
- Option A text: “How to Stay Invisible Online”; Option B: “Digital Age Secret Cells.”  
- Use silhouette + encrypted chat bubbles; save to `/assets/thumbnails/video-11/` with mobile preview.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- TODO metadata `docs/work/epic-2/metadata/video-11-metadata.md` focusing on keywords “encrypted coordination India”, “Signal vs Telegram”, “internet shutdown playbook”.  
- Upload master `video-11-digital-coordination_4k.mp4` (H.264, 32 Mbps); upload Unlisted Wednesday 10:00 IST; schedule Wednesday 18:00 IST. End screen linking to Aadhaar episode and Algorithm Bubbles to continue civic literacy arc.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter/X:** Thread listing 5 security practices + reminder to use responsibly; include infographic from video.  
- **LinkedIn:** Angle on digital rights & policy; tag Internet Freedom Foundation, Access Now, CERT-In.  
- **Instagram Stories:** 4-frame “Coordination Checklist” with caution about legal context; include CTA to watch full decode.

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- Expect AB test of reach due to keywords; watch for platform flagging.  
- Engage with digital rights advocates in comments; capture suggestions for future encryption content.  
- Track retention for Act 2 case studies to gauge appetite for deeper tool tutorials.
