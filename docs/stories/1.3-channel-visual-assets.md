## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Channel Branding Assets:**
Channel banner, profile picture, and watermark are critical "UI" elements for YouTube channel's visual identity.
[Source: prd-section-3-ui-goals.md#3.3-core-screens-and-views]

### Channel Banner Specifications

**Dimensions:** 2560 x 1440 px
**Safe Area:** 1546 x 423 px center (text/logo must fit here)
**Optimization:** Readable on desktop, mobile, TV
[Source: prd-section-3-ui-goals.md#3.3-core-screens-and-views]

**Safe Area Explanation:**
- Desktop: Full banner visible (2560 x 1440)
- Tablet: Partial crop from sides
- Mobile: Significant crop, only center 1546 x 423 px visible
- TV: Similar to desktop but viewed from distance

**Content Recommendations:**
- Logo: Left or center of safe area
- Tagline: Within safe area
- Background: Can extend to full 2560 x 1440 (visual interest)
- Avoid placing critical text near edges

### Profile Picture Specifications

**Dimensions:** 800 x 800 px minimum (YouTube recommendation: up to 2048 x 2048)
**Format:** PNG or JPG
**Circular Crop:** Design will be cropped to circle automatically
**Use Case:** Displays next to every video, comment, community post
[Source: prd-section-3-ui-goals.md#3.3-core-screens-and-views]

**Design Considerations:**
- Use stacked logo variation (optimized for circular crop)
- High contrast for visibility at small sizes (40x40 px in comments)
- Avoid fine details that become unclear when small
- Center logo within square to ensure good circular crop

### Video Watermark Specifications

**Dimensions:** 150 x 150 px
**Format:** PNG with transparent background
**Placement:** Bottom-right corner
**Display:** Entire video (configured in YouTube Studio)
**Opacity:** Subtle, 20-30% opacity recommended
[Source: architecture.md#3.1-content-production-workflow]

**Design:** "d|a" monogram icon from brand identity
[Source: prd-section-3-ui-goals.md#3.5-branding]

**Purpose:**
- Brand consistency across all videos
- Anti-piracy (minimal, but helps)
- Professional appearance

### Brand Colors & Typography

**Colors:** Deep Indigo (#1A237E), Electric Cyan (#00E5FF), Saffron (#FF6D00)
**Typography:** Montserrat Bold (titles), Inter Regular (body)
[Source: prd-section-3-ui-goals.md#3.5-branding]

**Banner Design Approach:**
- Use brand colors prominently but not overwhelmingly
- Balance: Professional + approachable
- Cultural grounding: Indian visual elements without clichés
