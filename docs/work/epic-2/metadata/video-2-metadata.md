UPI Revolution: How India Went Cashless Without Plastic

## Description (≈240 words)
**UPI moves more money each month than India’s GDP. How did a zero-fee QR code beat credit cards, wallets, and cash in under a decade?**  

In this episode I retrace UPI’s journey from the JAM trinity to a global benchmark, revealing the policy choices, incentive design, and relentless iteration that made it India’s default payment language. We’ll unpack how banks, fintech apps, and small merchants aligned—plus the trade-offs we must confront as credit on UPI, cross-border linkages, and privacy debates heat up.
