## Opening Hook (0:00-0:30) | ~70 words
You can swipe through LinkedIn, work at a unicorn, or live in a gated community—but caste might still decide your marriage, your housing, your credit score, even your algorithmic feed. Tonight we map the invisible walls caste erects in 21st-century India and spotlight the people dismantling them.

## Introduction (0:30-1:30) | ~220 words
Caste atrocities dominate headlines when violence erupts. Yet most oppression is quieter: job referrals limited to same-community networks, rental refusals, algorithmic biases, biased school access. A 2023 Pew survey found 70% of Indians still prefer same-caste marriages; 43% say caste discrimination persists in their area {S1}. In corporate India, Dalits hold <2% of leadership roles {S2}. Digital platforms, AI models, and fintech risk amplifying bias if unexamined.

This decode breaks caste’s invisible walls into three acts. Act 1 visualizes where caste hides—housing, education, employment, credit, digital spaces—with data. Act 2 spotlights changemakers deploying law, technology, and community action to open doors. Act 3 outlines an actionable playbook for viewers—founders, policymakers, allies—to build a more equitable India.

## Act 1 – Mapping the Invisible Walls (1:30-6:30) | ~840 words
### Housing & Urban Spaces
An Urban Governance Lab study covering 12 Indian cities found 74% of Dalit and Muslim applicants faced rental discrimination {S3}. Brokers use coded language (“vegetarian family only”) to filter caste. Gated communities often require caste certificates for domestic staff. Informal settlements cluster along caste lines, limiting sanitation and services.

### Education & Skill Pipelines
Despite reservations, NCERT data shows dropout rates at senior secondary level remain 5 percentage points higher for SC students than others {S4}. Coaching institutes and elite private schools subtly discourage Dalit or tribal admissions. Digital divide worsens: only 25% of SC/ST households have access to computers versus 45% for upper castes {S5}.

### Employment & Corporate Ladder
CMIE data indicates unemployment among SC/ST graduates is 2.2 times higher than upper castes {S6}. Hiring bias persists—resume experiments reveal identical qualifications with Dalit-sounding names receive 50% fewer callbacks {S7}. In tech companies, anonymous surveys show caste-based slurs disguised as “culture fit” concerns.

### Credit & Entrepreneurship
Fintech inclusion is uneven. A RBI study found SC entrepreneurs receive loans with 150 bps higher interest on average {S8}. Collateral requirements penalize those without ancestral property. Venture capital networks remain dominated by upper-caste circles; Dalit entrepreneurs raise <1% of VC funding {S9}.

### Digital & Algorithmic Bias
Social media moderation misclassifies reclaimed caste slurs as hate speech, muting Dalit activists {S10}. AI models trained on biased data replicate discrimination in hiring, lending, and content recommendations. Language models may amplify stereotypes when prompted with caste terms.

### Everyday Social Life
Marriage patterns remain segregated—matrimonial websites filter by caste. Dining, temple access, and sports teams in rural areas still often segregate. In urban settings, microaggressions (jokes, exclusion from networks) create psychological walls.

## Act 2 – Cracks in the Wall (6:30-12:00) | ~780 words
### Legal & Policy Interventions
- **SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act** enforcement improved via fast-track courts and e-FIR portals.  
- **Supreme Court 2023 judgment** mandated caste data collection in CO-WIN and other platforms to evaluate scheme impact.  
- **Telangana’s Dalit Bandhu** provides ₹10 lakh direct capital grant per Dalit family to start businesses {S11}.

### Technology & Data Activism
Projects like **Equality Labs** and **Dalit-led AI collectives** audit algorithmic bias, working with tech firms to adjust filters {S10}. Startups such as **PeriFerry** build inclusive HR pipelines for marginalized communities. Civic tech groups develop landlord-rating platforms to expose discrimination.

### Grassroots & Community Models
Organizations like **Jan Sahas** run migrant worker helplines; **Bhim Army** leverages digital literacy for justice; **Social Entrepreneurship Ventures** in Tamil Nadu provide micro-franchises for Dalit women. Student groups fight for representation in campuses (Ambedkar Students’ Associations).

### Corporate Inclusion
Companies like **Godrej**, **HCL**, **Infosys** adopt “caste inclusion charters” featuring anonymized resume screening, mentorship, and caste-sensitivity training. VC funds (e.g., **CXXO**, **The/Nudge** incubator) earmark capital for Dalit/Adivasi founders.

### Cultural Narratives
Filmmakers (Neeraj Ghaywan, Mari Selvaraj), writers (Suraj Yengde), and Dalit-led media break silence. Social media campaigns #DalitHistoryMonth, #CasteIsNotPast amplify stories. Podcasts and comics bring caste conversations to youth.

## Act 3 – Building the Playbook (12:00-16:30) | ~750 words
### For Policy Makers
1. **Caste Data Transparency:** Implement nationwide socio-economic caste census with granular anonymized release for researchers.  
2. **Urban Housing Reforms:** Mandate anti-discrimination clauses in tenancy laws; create municipal watchdogs; digitize grievance portals.  
3. **Credit Guarantees:** Expand Stand-Up India with collateral-free loans; integrate caste equity scoring into SIDBI and NABARD to channel credit.  
4. **Education Support:** Early childhood interventions, bridging scholarship for SC/ST students entering elite schools; mainstream digital labs in government schools.

### For Businesses & Startups
1. **Inclusive Hiring:** Blind resume screening, structured interviews, tie-ups with Dalit talent networks (Velivada, Bahujan Professionals).  
2. **Supplier Diversity:** Track caste representation in procurement; set targets similar to gender diversity goals.  
3. **Culture & Training:** Implement caste-sensitivity workshops, support groups, zero-tolerance policies.  
4. **Invest in Founders:** Set aside funds for marginalized entrepreneurs, offer advisory/mentor boards inclusive by design.

### For Tech Platforms
1. **Audit Algorithms:** Collaborate with independent auditors; create appeal pathways for activists flagged erroneously.  
2. **Product Features:** Add caste equity filters in newsfeeds (celebrate positive narratives), highlight caste-blind matchmaking options.  
3. **Moderation Training:** Include caste context in AI training data; involve Dalit experts.

### For Individuals
1. **Referrals & Networks:** Actively refer marginalized colleagues; support mentorship programs.  
2. **Self-Education:** Engage with Dalit literature, history, podcasts; call out microaggressions.  
3. **Community Support:** Donate time/capital to NGOs tackling caste barriers; volunteer in literacy/career guidance.

### Monitoring & Accountability
Establish a public “Caste Equity Dashboard” tracking representation in education, corporate boards, start-up funding, and credit distribution. Encourage states to publish progress annually.

## Conclusion (16:30-17:15) | ~210 words
Caste still shapes opportunities, but invisible walls can crumble. The barriers manifest in housing, education, employment, finance, and digital life. Yet change-makers—from activists to entrepreneurs—show how policy, technology, and community action can restructure systems. Every viewer can play a role: advocate data transparency, support inclusive hiring, and challenge biases. Freedom is most powerful when invisible walls fall.
