# Video 13 Work: "Trapped in Algorithm Bubbles: Escaping the Personalized Prison"

## Research & Script Status
- Script: `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/fullscripts/video-13-algorithm-bubbles.md` — 2,250-word exploration of recommender systems and Indian impacts.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/research-notes/video-13-algorithm-bubbles.md` collecting platform recommendation papers, Indian misinformation studies (BoomLive, IIT Kanpur), pricing investigations, and mental health reports (ICMR).
- Validation: Update latest recommendation transparency initiatives (YouTube, Instagram) and check for new CCI rulings on algorithmic pricing before release.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** OBS profile `Decode_MultiColor`; background: blurred feed with bubble overlay animation. Frame Obsbot Tiny 2 center with diagonal accent lighting.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano cardioid, gain 10 o’clock; filters—high-pass 80 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (-18 dB), limiter -3 dB.
- **Lighting:** Use dual-tone lighting—cool on one side (algorithm) warm on other (human) to visualise contrast; white balance 5000K.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva diagrams (recommender pipeline, feedback loops), bubble infographic, “Serendipity Sunday” checklist. Export to `assets/graphics/video-13/`. Prepare table comparing chronological vs algorithmic feeds.
- **B-Roll:** Screen capture YouTube recommendation page, Instagram Explore, Netflix row. Film manual actions (clearing watch history, using lists). Document source of stats.

## Recording Plan
1. Rehearse emphasising transitional statements telling viewers actionable steps.  
2. Record two VO takes; maintain energetic tone for empowerment message.  
3. Export WAVs; Audacity noise reduction + gentle multiband compression.  
4. Capture screen flows of feed reset actions and alternative discovery methods.  
5. Store assets `/videos/raw/video-13/{voiceover,screen,broll}/`.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- 4K sequence, 25 fps.  
- Use bubble transition overlays to visualise echo chambers; pop effect when discussing escape tactics.  
- Color grading: slightly increased saturation to differentiate bubble vs open scenes.  
- Audio: Normalize to -16 LUFS; music “Exploring New Worlds” (YouTube Audio Library) at -28 LUFS; add subtle pop SFX during “Burst the bubble” bullets.  
- Captions: highlight action steps with [ACTION] tags in text; export `video-13-algorithm-bubbles-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- Tech & Society template.  
- Option A: “Caught in Your Feed?” with bubble enclosing face; Option B: “Pop the Algorithm Bubble.”  
- Save to `/assets/thumbnails/video-13/` plus mobile preview.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- TODO metadata `docs/work/epic-2/metadata/video-13-metadata.md` with keywords “filter bubble India”, “YouTube recommendations”, “algorithmic transparency”.  
- Upload master `video-13-algorithm-bubbles_4k.mp4` (H.264, 32 Mbps); upload Unlisted Monday 11:00 IST; schedule Monday 18:00 IST. End screen linking to AI Content Filters video and Tech & Society playlist.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter/X:** Thread summarizing 4 bubble-busting habits plus poll “Do you use chronological feeds?”  
- **LinkedIn:** Discuss organisational use of diverse information diets; tag media literacy experts, CCI.  
- **Instagram carousel:** Steps to reset feed, diversify content, set serendipity rituals; final slide CTA.

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- Track comments for additional discovery tips; consider collating into downloadable guide.  
- Analytics: watch retention for Act 3—if high, repurpose as short “Algorithm Diet” series.  
- Compare CTR vs AI Content Filters to test packaging of algorithm topics.
