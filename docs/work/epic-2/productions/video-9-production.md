# Video 9 Work: "Hidden Cells: Secret Societies of Pre-Independence India"

## Research & Script Status
- Script: `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/fullscripts/video-9-secret-societies-pre-independence-india.md` — 2,350-word narrative covering Anushilan Samiti, HSRA, INA intelligence.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/research-notes/video-9-secret-societies-pre-independence-india.md` to log archival sources (National Archives files, Heehs, HSRA manifesto), imagery credits, and moderation plan tie-ins.
- Verification: Cross-check key dates (Muzaffarpur 1908, Kakori 1925, Naval Mutiny 1946) and ensure map assets cite original archives.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** OBS profile `Decode_Chronicle`; sepia-toned parchment background with subtle animated grain. Frame Obsbot Tiny 2 mid-shot for storytelling vibe.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano cardioid, gain 11 o’clock; high-pass 80 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (-18 dB), limiter -3 dB. Capture room tone for historical ambience mixing.
- **Lighting:** Warm key light (2900K bulb) plus dim fill; white balance 4300K to retain vintage feel.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva timelines, organizational charts of cells, photographs (public domain) with parchment frames. Export to `assets/graphics/video-9/`. Prepare moderation reminder slide referencing video-3 plan.
- **B-Roll:** Capture scans of archival documents (where permitted), books, letters; film fountain pen writing codes. Indicate attribution for each archival image.

## Recording Plan
1. Rehearse narrative pacing, emphasising names and events; mark dramatic pauses pre/post key revelations.  
2. Record two VO takes; consider whisper track for emphasis (optional).  
3. Export WAVs; use Audacity to add subtle room reverb (very light) for historical ambience.  
4. Screen record map animations and code examples.  
5. Organize files in `/videos/raw/video-9/` with proper naming.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- 4K sequence, 25 fps.  
- Apply “Old Film” adjustment layer (grain 5%, tint) over archival visuals.  
- Use push-in zooms on photographs to maintain interest.  
- Audio: Normalize to -16 LUFS; underscore with “Dramatic Documentary” track at -30 LUFS; add Morse code SFX during coordination segment (Act 2).  
- Captions: Provide pronunciation guides in brackets when relevant. Export `video-9-secret-societies-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- India’s Future pillar (saffron) with sepia overlay.  
- Option A: “India’s Underground Revolution” with silhouetted figures; Option B: “Secret Cells vs Empire.”  
- Save to `/assets/thumbnails/video-9/` plus mobile preview.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- TODO metadata `docs/work/epic-2/metadata/video-9-metadata.md` (include keywords “Anushilan Samiti”, “HSRA”, “INA intelligence”).  
- Upload master `video-9-secret-societies_4k.mp4` (H.264, 30 Mbps); upload Unlisted Friday 11:00 IST; schedule Friday 18:00 IST. End screen linking to Video 3 (India as Center of Human History) and community moderation guidelines.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter/X:** Thread outlining three groups + modern lessons; share archival image with permissions.  
- **LinkedIn:** Focus on organisational discipline lessons for modern civic tech; tag National Archives, historians.  
- **Instagram carousel:** 5 slides with vintage aesthetic spotlighting each society + lesson.

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- Monitor comments for sensitive political takes; enforce moderation policy.  
- Collect historian recommendations for resources; update research note.  
- Evaluate retention across Act 2 (tools of secrecy) for pacing insights.
