# Story 2.1 Work: Script Template & Research Workflow

## Deliverables Snapshot
- **Script template:** `docs/work/epic-2/templates/video-script-template.md` — Markdown structure with brand voice prompts, visual beat placeholders, and YAML metadata aligned to OBS + Premiere workflow.
- **Research notes template:** `docs/work/epic-2/templates/research-notes-template.md` — Table-driven note-taking file for `/scripts/research-notes/{slug}.md`.
- **Script length calculator:** `docs/work/epic-2/workflows/script-length-guide.md` — Section-by-section word targets, formulas, and pacing reminders for 140 WPM delivery.
- **Research workflow:** `docs/work/epic-2/workflows/research-workflow.md` — End-to-end sourcing, evaluation, fact-check, and archival process tuned to Markdown tooling.
- **Example script:** `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/fullscripts/video-1-indian-startups-high-tech-gap.md` — 2,439-word production-ready draft for Video 1 demonstrating template usage.

## Usage Guidance
- When starting a new episode, duplicate the script template and update YAML metadata; cross-check word counts using the length guide before recording in OBS Studio.
- Maintain research notes in the template format so citations `{S#}` map cleanly into scripts and later metadata.
- Follow the research workflow’s seven-step loop to keep sourcing disciplined and ensure fact-check logs live alongside scripts.
- The example script doubles as a tone benchmark for the “Indian Startups High-Tech Gap” episode referenced in Stories 2.2 and 2.3.

## Next Steps
- Stand up a `/scripts/2025-10/` directory when ready to move templates from `docs/work/epic-2/templates/`.
- Capture feedback on the example script after the first table read and update the template if any structural friction appears.
