## Research & Script Status
- Script: `epic-2/fullscripts/video-16-caste-invisible-walls.md` — 2,400-word investigation into caste barriers and solutions.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `epic-2/research-notes/video-16-caste-invisible-walls.md` capturing datasets (Pew, CMIE, NSSO, Equality Labs), case studies, and quotes from activists and corporate inclusion leaders.
- Validation: Refresh corporate diversity reports, Dalit Bandhu updates, and RBI financial inclusion stats before recording. Gather 2025 Any other major incidents for examples.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** OBS profile `Decode_SaffronTeal`; background collage of urban skylines fading into rural landscapes to symbolise hidden barriers. Frame Obsbot Tiny 2 centrally with enough space for stat overlays.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano cardioid, gain 10 o’clock; high-pass 80 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (-18 dB), limiter -3 dB. Capture room tone.
- **Lighting:** Soft key light + fill; warm tones for empathetic storytelling. White balance 4700K.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva infographics (housing discrimination stats, education dropouts, credit access chart), feature cards for change-makers, action checklist. Export to `assets/graphics/video-16/`. Prepare lower-thirds for quotes.
- **B-Roll:** Capture stock/own footage of urban housing boards, classroom, office scenes; record interviews clips (if available) or use text overlays. Screen record relevant reports (Equality Labs, Dalit Bandhu portal). Document licenses.

## Recording Plan
1. Rehearse emphasising respectful tone and balanced pacing between problem and solutions.  
2. Record two VO takes; watch pronunciation for names (PeriFerry, Suraj Yengde).  
3. Export WAVs; apply Audacity noise reduction + de-esser (5–6 kHz).  
4. Capture screen walkthrough showing data charts and activist platforms.  
5. Store assets `/videos/raw/video-16/{voiceover,screen,broll}/`; maintain metadata sheet noting sensitive references.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- Timeline 3840 × 2160, 25 fps, 48 kHz audio.  
- Structure: Hook montage (housing board, office, algorithm screenshot) → Act 1 (mapping) → Act 2 (changemakers) → Act 3 (playbook).  
- Color: Slight warm grade (+5 temperature) to create human tone; highlight infographics with high-contrast palettes.  
- Audio: Normalize VO to -16 LUFS; music bed “Resilient Hope” (YouTube Audio Library) at -32 LUFS. Use ambient city sounds subtly in montage.  
- Captions: Pay attention to Indian names/terms; export `video-16-caste-walls-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- India’s Future saffron palette with subtle gritty texture.  
- Option A: “Invisible Caste Walls” with shadow silhouette; Option B: “Who Gets In?” overlaying gated community.
