# Story 1.4 Work: Channel Trailer Package

## Final Script (≈185 words / 55 seconds)
- **00:00 – 00:07 | Hook**  
  - VO: *“What if the next decade of India’s growth is decided by choices we barely notice today?”*  
  - Visual: Fast cuts of Mumbai skyline timelapse, semiconductor wafer close-up, parliament silhouette.  
- **00:07 – 00:32 | Value Proposition**  
  - VO: *“I’m Anand. Every week on decodebyanand we break apart the forces rewriting India’s future—AI policy, climate technology, space missions, geopolitical alignments—and rebuild them with clear frameworks you can act on. No outrage bait. Just research, systems thinking, and uncommon optimism. We dig into how technology collides with society, how science shapes philosophy, and how India can play offense in a turbulent world. I do the heavy reading, talk to builders and policymakers, and translate complex reports into 15-minute deep dives designed for founders, students, civil servants, and restless citizens.”*  
  - Visual: Split-screen of Anand at desk, overlayed frameworks, snippets of upcoming episodes (graphs, maps, lab footage).  
- **00:32 – 00:47 | Credibility & Community**  
  - VO: *“Every episode comes with show notes, data sources, and community polls that shape what we decode next. We move fast—three drops a week at 6 PM IST—plus live breakdowns when the story can’t wait. Expect uncomfortable questions, honest analysis, and a community that debates with respect.”*  
  - Visual: Screen capture of Notion notes, community poll UI mock, montage of viewer comments.  
- **00:47 – 00:55 | Call to Action**  
  - VO: *“If you want to see India’s future before the headlines, subscribe, hit the bell, and bring someone who loves big ideas. Let’s decode what’s next—together.”*  
  - Visual: Channel logo animation leading into subscribe CTA and playlist placeholders.

## Voiceover Recording Notes
- **Tone:** Confident, energetic, avoid broadcast boom—aim for informed guide.  
- **Pacing:** Maintain 105–115 words per minute; pause 0.5 seconds between sections for edit flexibility.  
- **Audio Specs:** Capture in OBS Studio with Blue Yeti Nano (cardioid, gain at 25–30%), 48 kHz / 24-bit WAV; keep peaks below -3 dBFS.  
- **Post:** Clean using Audacity or Premiere DeNoise (light reduction), apply gentle de-ess around 6 kHz, add soft compression (3:1, -20 dB threshold).

## Visual & B-Roll Plan
- Anchor shots of Anand in workspace using Obsbot Tiny 2 mounted near monitor; boost room lighting with desk lamp bounced off white wall.  
- Capture macro cutaways on iPhone 15 (4K 30 fps) for circuits, books, and dashboard scrolls; stabilize in Premiere if handheld.  
- Use Canva animated overlays matching Story 1.2 color tokens; apply decoding motif via vertical crop animations in Premiere.  
- Integrate 1–2 news headline screenshots under fair use; blur logos and keep on-screen <2 seconds.  
- When referencing community, display anonymized comment mockups designed in Canva with Rajdhani Bold headings.

## Edit Blueprint
- Structure timeline as Hook → Value Proposition → Social Proof → CTA.  
- Add 0.3s whoosh between beats; bed music sourced from YouTube Audio Library (e.g., “Future Ambient 009”) mixed at -24 LUFS.  
- Insert captions manually (white text, charcoal background pill, Rajdhani for Hindi terms).  
- Color correct with Premiere Lumetri: adjust temperature/tint only, lift shadows slightly to offset room lighting; verify skin tones via vectorscope target.  
- Intro/outro transitions should align with Story 1.6 deliverables once available.

## Distribution Checklist
- Export master at 4K (3840 × 2160, 24 fps, 45 Mbps VBR 2-pass).  
- Create 1080p derivative for faster upload testing.  
- Upload as unlisted, gather feedback, then switch to public and set as channel trailer + featured video.  
- After 7 days, review analytics: impressions, CTR, average view duration, subscribers gained, and note learnings in analytics log.
