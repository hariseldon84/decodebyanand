# Video 22 Work: "Traditional Jobs → Gig Economy"

## Research & Script Status
- Script: `epic-2/fullscripts/video-22-traditional-jobs-to-gig-economy.md` — 2,350-word state-of-gig work analysis with policy playbook.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `epic-2/research-notes/video-22-gig-economy.md` capturing NITI Aayog data, platform earnings studies, labour code updates, union activity, fintech products for gig workers.
- Validation: Refresh wage and workforce numbers, track recent state legislation (Rajasthan, Karnataka Gig Workers Acts), platform incentives, and union protests before recording.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** OBS profile `Decode_GigShift`; background collage of delivery riders, freelancers, and traditional offices fading into app icons. Frame Obsbot Tiny 2 center-left; leave right side for charts.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano cardioid, gain 10 o’clock; high-pass 80 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (-18 dB), limiter -3 dB. Capture room tone.
- **Lighting:** Warm key with soft fill to humanize labour story. White balance 4800K.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva charts (gig workforce growth, income volatility, benefits comparison), case study cards, playbook checklist. Export to `assets/graphics/video-22/`.
- **B-Roll:** Shoot/collect footage of delivery riders, call centers, freelancers at laptops, union meetings. Screen capture gig apps (Zomato, Swiggy, ONDC seller onboarding) with permissions.

## Recording Plan
1. Rehearse script focusing on balanced tone (highlight opportunities + risks).  
2. Record two VO takes; ensure clarity when mentioning policies and acronyms (ESIC, FAME, ONDC).  
3. Export WAVs; Audacity noise reduction + slight EQ to enhance warmth.  
4. Capture screen walkthroughs of charts, e-Shram portal, union headlines.  
5. Store assets `/videos/raw/video-22/{voiceover,screen,broll}/`; update asset tracking sheet.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- 4K timeline, 25 fps.  
- Use kinetic typography for gig worker quotes and pay figures.  
- Color grade: warm mid-tones; highlight data overlays with contrasting colors.  
- Audio: Normalize VO to -16 LUFS; bed track “Urban Pulse” (YouTube Audio Library) at -30 LUFS. Add subtle ambient city sounds in intro/outro.  
- Captions: Double-check Indian terminology; export `video-22-gig-economy-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- India’s Future palette (saffron + teal).  
- Option A: “Gig Boom or Bust?” with rider silhouette; Option B: “Goodbye 9-to-5?” with split office vs rider.  
- Save PNG to `assets/thumbnails/video-22/`; produce 320 × 180 preview.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- TODO metadata `epic-2/metadata/video-22-metadata.md` (keywords: gig economy India, labour codes, platform work).  
- Upload plan: export master `video-22-gig-economy_4k.mp4` (H.264, 32 Mbps); upload Unlisted Friday 12:00 IST; schedule Friday 18:00 IST. End screen linking to Caste videos and India’s Future playlist.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter/X:** Thread with workforce stats, worker stories, policy steps; poll “Should gig workers get PF/ESIC?”  
- **LinkedIn:** Focus on HR/policy; tag Labour Ministry, NITI Aayog, major platforms, unions.  
- **Instagram carousel:** Hook, data, worker quotes, playbook, CTA; Reel snippet featuring fairness checklist.

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- Monitor worker feedback; collect suggestions for resources to share in community post.  
- Analytics: track retention around policy heavy Act 3; adjust future labour content accordingly.  
- Log production effort and viewer sentiment in analytics tracker post-launch.
