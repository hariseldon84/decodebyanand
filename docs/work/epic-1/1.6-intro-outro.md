# Story 1.6 Work: Intro & Outro Sequence Blueprint

## Intro Sequence (5.8 seconds)
| Time | Visual | Motion Notes | Audio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0.0–0.6 s | Dark charcoal frame with cyan scan lines revealing vertical bars | Animate three vertical bars sliding in from left (ease-out) | Synth riser (pitch bend up) |
| 0.6–1.8 s | Bars expand to reveal `decode|by|anand` logotype | Logo strokes draw-on using trim paths; saffron accent flickers | Kick + snare hit synced to logo settling |
| 1.8–3.2 s | Background gradient shifts indigo → cyan; tagline fades in | Particle system forms behind text, motion blur 8 px | Pads build underneath |
| 3.2–4.6 s | Data grid animates upward, revealing episode pillar label | Label text (Montserrat Semibold 42 pt) slides up with mask | Soft impact emphasizing reveal |
| 4.6–5.8 s | Logo scales down to left, leaving negative space for cold open | Anticipation overshoot 102% then settle | Audio sting resolves with sub hit |

**Storyboard Notes**
- Incorporate decoding motif by masking footage through vertical bars before fully revealing.  
- Keep transitions under 8 frames to maintain snappy feel.  
- Prepare four pillar color variants (Saffron, Cyan, Indigo, Gold) triggered by metadata tag in editor.

## Outro Sequence (9.5 seconds)
- **Canvas:** 3840 × 2160 (master), design safe area 3320 × 1870.  
- **Layout:**  
  - Left third: Looping background of animated contour map with cyan highlights; overlay “Thanks for watching! Subscribe for weekly deep dives.” (Montserrat Bold 64 pt).  
  - Right two-thirds: Three panels aligned to YouTube end-screen grid.  
    - Panel A (top-right): Latest video placeholder (1280 × 720).  
    - Panel B (bottom-right): Recommended playlist placeholder.  
    - Panel C (bottom-center): Subscribe circle using stacked logo.  
- **Motion:** Panels slide in from slight Z-depth with parallax; hold final layout for last 6 seconds to allow YouTube end-screen timing.  
- **Audio:** Continue intro sting tail with shimmer pad; add subtle heartbeat bass at -20 dB to suggest anticipation.  
- **Call-to-Action:** Animate Rajdhani Bold lower-third at 7.5 s reading “Next: {Upcoming Topic}” to promote pipeline.

## Template Project Setup
1. Open Adobe Premiere Pro → create project `Decode_Template`.  
2. Set sequence preset to 3840 × 2160, 25 fps with maximum bit depth enabled.  
3. Import Canva motion backgrounds, OBS-rendered logo pass, and transparent PNG overlays.  
4. Create bins: `01_Intro`, `02_Outro`, `03_LowerThirds`, `04_Backgrounds`, `05_SFX`.  
5. Build Essential Graphics templates for pillar label and CTA, linking color controls to brand swatches.  
6. Save project to `/assets/branding/decode-template.prproj` and duplicate for each iteration.

## Audio Library Shortlist
- Pull licensed stems from YouTube Audio Library or Canva’s audio catalog.  
- Intro sting: select a 5-second cinematic synth swell (category: Cinematic) and trim to 5.8 s.  
- Outro bed: choose an ambient texture loop (~45 s, category: Ambient) and fade out at 10 s.  
- Store WAV exports in `/assets/audio/stings/` using `intro-sting-v1.wav`, `outro-pad-v1.wav`.

## Export Specifications
- **Intro:** Export QuickTime GoPro CineForm with alpha (Premiere standard) plus an H.264 MP4 delivery copy.  
- **Outro:** Match export formats; include a version with YouTube end-screen guides burned in for reference.  
- **Color Space:** Rec.709 Gamma 2.4; render at maximum depth and use hardware encoding for MP4.  
- **Naming:** `intro-sequence-v1.{ext}`, `outro-sequence-v1.{ext}`.

## QA Checklist
- Verify total duration: intro ≤6 s, outro ≤10 s.  
- Confirm audio peak below -1 dBFS, integrated loudness -16 LUFS.  
- Ensure end-screen placeholders align with YouTube 20% margins (test with template PNG).  
- Test alpha channel by overlaying on sample footage; inspect for fringe artifacts.  
- Document render settings in `assets/branding/README.md` and capture stills for brand kit.
