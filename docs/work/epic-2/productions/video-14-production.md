# Video 14 Work: "Tariff Wars: How Trade Battles Reshape India’s Future"

## Research & Script Status
- Script: `epic-2/fullscripts/video-14-tariff-wars.md` — 2,400-word data-backed breakdown of global tariff dynamics and India’s response.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `epic-2/research-notes/video-14-tariff-wars.md` to track sources (USITC, WTO, OECD, Economic Survey) and collect fresh data releases (tariff notifications, CBAM updates) ahead of recording.
- Validation: Reconfirm tariff statistics (US–China, India’s average applied duties) and CBAM timeline 48 hours pre-shoot; source latest trade diversion numbers (India exports to US/EU) for metadata references.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** OBS profile `Decode_GoldGraph`. Background: animated world map with trade arrows; include transparent overlay for key stats. Frame Obsbot Tiny 2 slightly right to leave room for data callouts.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano (cardioid, gain 10 o’clock); filters — high-pass 80 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (-18 dB), limiter -3 dB. Capture 30 s room tone for Audacity cleanup.
- **Lighting:** Neutral key light + warm accent on backdrop to reflect policy tone; white balance 4800K.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva charts for tariff escalations, CBAM timeline, India duty changes, sector heatmap. Export 3840 × 2160 PNGs to `assets/graphics/video-14/`. Prepare animated arrows for supply chain reroute (Vietnam/Mexico/India).
- **B-Roll:** Screen captures of WTO monitoring dashboard, UNCTAD graph, Economic Survey tables; iPhone footage of container yard, manufacturing plant, and consumer price tags to show growth-to-retail link. Document attribution.

## Recording Plan
1. Table-read script focusing on clarity around numeric data; mark pauses after each stat cluster.  
2. Record two VO takes in OBS “Audio Only” scene; flag mispronunciations (CBAM, TERI).  
3. Export WAVs; apply Audacity noise reduction + gentle de-esser (6 kHz).  
4. Screen record Canva slides, scrolling through global tariff maps and Indian notification PDFs; maintain cursor discipline.  
5. Organize assets under `/videos/raw/video-14/{voiceover,screen,broll}/` with consistent naming for edit handoff.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- Sequence: 3840 × 2160, 25 fps, 48 kHz audio.  
- Structure: Hook montage (container port + policy headlines) → Act 1 (global context) → Act 2 (India exposure) → Act 3 (playbook).  
- Color grade: Basic correction, slight contrast (+5) and saturation (+4) to accentuate data slides.  
- Audio: Normalize VO to -16 LUFS; bed music “Policy Pulse” (YouTube Audio Library) at -30 LUFS; add soft stingers before each act transition.  
- Graphics: Essential Graphics templates for bullet lists and “Playbook” steps; animate chart growth using keyframes.  
- Captions: Auto-generate, review numeric sections meticulously; export `video-14-tariff-wars-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- Geopolitics & Economics palette (gold/charcoal).  
- Option A: “Tariff Wars” bold text + split US/China/India flags; Option B: “Who Pays the Price?” overlaying container ship.  
- Export PNG (1280 × 720, <2 MB) to `assets/thumbnails/video-14/`; produce 320 × 180 preview for mobile legibility.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- TODO metadata file `epic-2/metadata/video-14-metadata.md` with SEO title, 220-word description, 20 tags (tariff wars, CBAM, Make in India, supply chains).  
- Upload workflow:  
  1. Export master `video-14-tariff-wars_4k.mp4` (H.264, 35 Mbps).  
  2. Upload as Unlisted Saturday 13:00 IST; attach captions, thumbnail, metadata.  
  3. Configure end screen (Subscribe, Geopolitics & Economics playlist, next video teaser).  
  4. Add chapters aligning with act headings; schedule publish for Wednesday 18:00 IST.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter/X thread (6 tweets):** global stat, India exposure, CBAM alert, MSME support tip, policy recommendation, CTA question “Which tariff hit you hardest?”  
- **LinkedIn post:** focus on corporate strategy (supply chain hedging, green compliance); tag CII, FIEO, MEA.  
- **Instagram carousel:** 5 slides (headline, global stat, Indian sector heatmap, playbook step, CTA) plus 15-second Reel summarizing Act 3.

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- Watch comments for updates on ongoing trade negotiations; collect leads for future episodes.  
- Analytics: track retention at each act transition and CTR vs other Geopolitics videos; note if charts affect drop-off.  
- Add metrics to `analytics/batch-production-efficiency.md` once edit completes; adjust future policy content pacing based on feedback.
