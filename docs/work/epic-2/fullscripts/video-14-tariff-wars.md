## Opening Hook (0:00-0:30) | ~70 words
One executive order in Washington raises steel tariffs, Beijing retaliates with soybean bans, Europe taxes carbon at the border—and suddenly Indian exporters scramble, farmers panic, and consumers feel it at the checkout. Tariff wars aren’t a distant thunderclap anymore; they redraw supply chains we rely on daily. Tonight we decode how trade battles erupt, where India is vulnerable, and how we can turn volatility into strategic leverage.

## Introduction (0:30-1:30) | ~210 words
Tariffs—the border taxes on imports—are back at the center of geopolitics. Since 2018, the US–China sparring drove average US tariff rates from 3.5% to nearly 20% on Chinese goods {S1}. The EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) applies fees on carbon-intensive imports, while India raises duties on electronics and toys to push Make in India. The World Trade Organization counts over 3,000 restrictive measures since the pandemic, a fourfold jump from the pre-2008 era {S2}. For a country like India, aspiring to $2 trillion in exports by 2030, tariff crossfire can derail growth or become a catalyst, depending on how we respond.

In this decode, Act 1 unpacks why tariff wars are escalating—the economic logic, political motives, and data. Act 2 zooms into India’s exposure: sectors under threat, opportunities, and domestic policy moves. Act 3 outlines India’s playbook: hedging supply chains, negotiating trade pacts, and investing in competitiveness. We’ll use examples—from solar panels to apples—to show how every viewer is already affected.

## Act 1 – The New Age of Tariff Battles (1:30-6:00) | ~750 words
Tariffs used to be mainstay revenue; today they’re geopolitical weapons. The US–China trade war triggered some of the largest hikes: US duties on $360 billion of Chinese goods jumped to 25%; China retaliated with 5–25% duties on $110 billion of US imports {S1}. This decoupling isn’t isolated—global average tariffs crept upward as economies pushed industrial policy.

### Three Drivers
1. **Strategic Competition:** Nations seek to secure supply chains in semiconductors, EVs, rare earths. Tariffs and export controls become industrial policy disguised as national security.  
2. **Domestic Politics:** Tariffs signal strength to voters. The US’ Section 232 steel tariffs catered to Rust Belt constituents; India’s hikes on toys and electronics supported MSMEs.  
3. **Green Transition:** CBAM, US Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, and India’s green hydrogen incentives create “climate tariffs,” penalizing carbon-heavy imports.

### Data Snapshot
- WTO monitoring shows 67% of new measures since 2020 are trade restrictive, highest since the 1990s {S2}.  
- The G20 implemented 500 new import measures in 2024 alone {S3}.  
- Semiconductor equipment faces export controls; South Korea’s steel exports to the US dropped 28% after Section 232 before quotas stabilized {S4}.

### Spillovers
Tariffs cascade into global prices. A Fed study estimated US consumers bore 90% of the cost of post-2018 tariffs through higher prices {S5}. Supply chains adjust—Vietnam and Mexico captured market share as companies rerouted production. Trade diversion benefits countries agile enough to plug into new networks.

## Act 2 – India’s Exposure & Openings (6:00-11:00) | ~780 words
India is both target and instigator. Since 2014, average applied tariff rose from 13.5% to ~18% as India pursued self-reliance {S6}. Sectors affected:

### Electronics & Smartphones
India raised customs duty on mobile phones to 20% (2023) to encourage local manufacturing. Apple responded by shifting assembly to India, but component imports still face duties, increasing costs {S7}. If destination countries retaliate with tariffs on Indian electronics, gains erode.

### Solar Panels
India imposed 40% Basic Customs Duty (BCD) on solar modules to reduce Chinese dependency. Short term, project costs rose 18%; long term, domestic manufacturers invested in 25 GW capacity {S8}. US/EU anti-dumping duties on Chinese panels create export potential for India if quality improves.

### Steel and Aluminium
India faces US Section 232 tariffs (25% steel, 10% aluminium). Negotiations continue; the EU threatens carbon tariffs via CBAM from 2026. Indian steel’s emissions intensity (2.55 t CO₂/t steel) exceeds EU thresholds {S9}, risking competitiveness unless we decarbonize.

### Agriculture
Apple exporters from the US lost market share after India imposed retaliatory tariffs in 2019; once duties dropped in 2023, US apples re-entered. Pulses from Myanmar face periodic restrictions, impacting Indian prices.

### Opportunity: Trade Diversion
Vietnam, Bangladesh, and India benefit from supply chain shifts. India’s exports to the US rose 20% in 2023 as buyers diversified from China, especially in textiles, chemicals, and engineering goods {S10}.

### Domestic Policy Moves
- **PLI Schemes**: Tariffs combined with incentives aim to foster domestic champions in mobiles, batteries, solar, semiconductors.  
- **FTA Negotiations**: India signed agreements with UAE, Australia (ECTA), resumed talks with UK, EU, Canada.  
- **Import Licensing**: Recent laptop import curbs triggered global concerns; India postponed full enforcement after industry feedback.

India must balance protecting nascent industries with avoiding retaliatory backlash that harms exports. Farmers depend on cheap fertilizer imports; auto exports need open markets. Tariff wars demand surgical strategy.

## Act 3 – India’s Playbook (11:00-16:00) | ~780 words
### 1. Hedge with Multiple Supply Chains
Encourage “China+1+India” networks. Promote joint ventures with Vietnam, Thailand, Mexico to keep market access if tariffs shift. Offer Indian logistics parks for nearshoring. Trade credit insurance and export guarantees can cushion shocks.

### 2. Aggressive Trade Negotiations
Finalize FTAs with UK and EU to pre-empt CBAM impact by aligning standards. Use India’s G20 leadership to advocate carbon-credit recognition so Indian green steel gets tariff relief. Expand rupee trade settlements with BRICS to mitigate dollar-denominated sanction risk.

### 3. Competitiveness & Quality
Tariffs alone can breed complacency. Invest in technology, skilling, and R&D. Use the ₹4 lakh crore PLI outlay to create export champions, not protected dinosaurs. Benchmark costs vs ASEAN peers.

### 4. Climate Alignment
Prepare for CBAM by accelerating green steel, green aluminium projects (hydrogen-based direct reduction). Launch carbon accounting systems; incentivize industry adoption. Collaborate with EU on carbon markets to secure exemptions.

### 5. MSME Buffer
Tariff swings hurt MSMEs lacking hedging tools. Set up Tariff Impact Cells in export promotion councils: offer data dashboards, policy alerts, subsidized hedging products. Leverage ONDC for domestic substitution where imports face high duties.

### 6. Consumer Protection
Transparent communication on price impacts; targeted subsidies or tax rebates when tariffs raise essential prices (e.g., cooking oil). Encourage domestic competition to avoid rent seeking.

### 7. Strategic Stockpiles
For critical minerals, semiconductors, fertilizers—build reserves to weather tariff-driven shortages. Deploy sovereign funds to acquire overseas assets (like fertilizer plants, lithium mines).

### 8. Digital Monitoring
Use AI dashboards combining customs data, shipping manifests, and social media sentiment to detect tariff shocks early. Empower the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) with predictive analytics.

## Conclusion (16:00-17:15) | ~200 words
Tariff wars will define the next decade. They’re not random; they reflect strategic competition, domestic politics, and climate urgency. India can either be caught in crossfire or steer the landscape. By diversifying supply chains, negotiating smart FTAs, and building competitive export ecosystems, we turn turbulence into leverage.

Tariffs should be tools, not crutches. Used wisely, they can buy time for capacity building; used poorly, they tax consumers and isolate us. The choice is ours.
