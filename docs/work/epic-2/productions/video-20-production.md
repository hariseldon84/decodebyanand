# Video 20 Work: "Human Decisions → AI"

## Research & Script Status
- Script: `epic-2/fullscripts/video-20-human-decisions-to-ai.md` — 2,350-word examination of AI-led decision systems and governance.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `epic-2/research-notes/video-20-human-to-ai.md` documenting sector case studies (finance, health, law, HR), bias reports, regulatory frameworks (RBI, MeitY, EU AI Act).
- Validation: Update stats on AI adoption (Account Aggregator usage, AI healthcare deployments), check any new Supreme Court or MeitY guidelines on AI before recording.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** OBS profile `Decode_AIControl`; background digital motif with neural network patterns. Frame Obsbot Tiny 2 center with overlay area on right for examples.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano cardioid, gain 10 o’clock; high-pass 80 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (-18 dB), limiter -3 dB. Capture room tone.
- **Lighting:** Balanced cool lighting to match tech theme; white balance 5000K.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva diagrams (AI decision pipeline, risk matrix, governance playbook), case study cards. Export to `assets/graphics/video-20/`. Prepare overlay icons representing sectors.
- **B-Roll:** Record screen flows of AI dashboards (credit scoring, telehealth), simulate algorithmic decision notifications, gather stock footage of professionals interacting with AI tools. Note licensing.

## Recording Plan
1. Rehearse emphasising clarity when explaining bias and governance frameworks; mark sections needing additional emphasis.  
2. Record two VO takes; ensure acronyms (AIA, AI Bill of Rights) are clear.  
3. Export WAVs; Audacity noise reduction + presence boost.  
4. Capture screen walkthroughs for each use case and playbook steps.  
5. Store assets `/videos/raw/video-20/{voiceover,screen,broll}/`; document mapping of visuals to script.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- 4K timeline, 25 fps.  
- Use glitch transitions sparingly to signify machine decisions; apply color-coded overlays (red=risks, green=playbook).  
- Audio: Normalize VO to -16 LUFS; bed music “Digital Equilibrium” (YouTube Audio Library) at -32 LUFS. Add subtle SFX (notification chimes) when referencing automated decisions.  
- Captions: Ensure technical terminology spelled correctly; export `video-20-human-ai-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- Tech & Society palette (cyan/charcoal).  
- Option A: “AI Decides For You?” with robot hand over checklist; Option B: “Humans vs Algorithms” split portrait.  
- Save PNG to `assets/thumbnails/video-20/`; create 320 × 180 preview.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- TODO metadata `epic-2/metadata/video-20-metadata.md` (keywords: AI decision-making India, algorithmic governance, bias audits).  
- Upload plan: export master `video-20-human-to-ai_4k.mp4` (H.264, 32 Mbps); upload Unlisted Monday 12:00 IST; schedule Monday 18:00 IST. End screen linking to Algorithm Bubbles and Tech & Society playlist.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter/X thread:** highlight 4 sectors, share governance playbook, invite comments on AI oversight.  
- **LinkedIn:** focus on enterprise adoption and policy; tag RBI, IndiaAI, corporate CTOs.  
- **Instagram carousel:** Hook, use-case snapshots, risk list, governance steps, CTA; Reel showing AI vs human decision split.

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- Monitor comments for real-world examples/bias incidents; curate for follow-up content.  
- Track retention around Act 2 (risk section) to refine pacing.  
- Update analytics log with production time, view metrics once video is live.
