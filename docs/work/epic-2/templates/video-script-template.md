### Usage Notes
- Draft in Markdown editor to preserve structure. Use `<!-- editor notes -->` for production-only reminders.
- Maintain word counts with the [script length guide](../workflows/script-length-guide.md); adjust per act while holding total to 2,100–2,800 words.
- When adapting for teleprompter, export to plain text without Markdown headings. Keep section timestamps visible for OBS scene switches.
