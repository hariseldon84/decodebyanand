# Video 12 Work: "AI Content Filters: Invisible Editors of Your Reality"

## Research & Script Status
- Script: `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/fullscripts/video-12-ai-content-filters.md` — 2,300-word breakdown of moderation AI and Indian impact.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/research-notes/video-12-ai-content-filters.md` logging platform transparency reports (Meta, TikTok), Indian regulatory updates (IT Rules), audit studies, and cultural case studies.
- Checks: Refresh enforcement metrics (Meta Q3 2025, TikTok 2025), note any new MeitY advisories or court rulings affecting content moderation.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** OBS profile `Decode_GreyGradient`; background: blurred feed with AI overlay icons. Frame Obsbot Tiny 2 center-left; leave space for statistic overlays.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano cardioid, gain 10 o’clock; filters—high-pass 80 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (-18 dB), limiter -3 dB.
- **Lighting:** Balanced cool-neutral lighting (WB 4900K) to convey analytical tone. Use light panels to avoid screen glare.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva charts (removal rates, language bias), pipeline diagrams, governance playbook visuals. Export to `assets/graphics/video-12/`. Prepare screenshot of Instagram “Account Status”.
- **B-Roll:** Screen capture transparency dashboards, demonetisation yellow icon, Instagram sensitive content setting. Record talking-head with overlay of flagged post.

## Recording Plan
1. Rehearse focusing on clarity while covering technical pipeline; mark rhetorical questions to keep engagement.  
2. Record two VO takes; ensure correct pronouncing of Perspective API, DPDP, BIS.  
3. Export WAVs; Audacity noise reduction + mild EQ (boost 3 kHz).  
4. Capture screen walkthrough of dashboards and creator controls.  
5. Save assets under `/videos/raw/video-12/{voiceover,screen,broll}/`.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- 4K timeline, 25 fps.  
- Use UI overlays to simulate moderation pipeline; animate arrow flow.  
- Color grading: neutral contrast; lighten slides for readability.  
- Audio: Normalize to -16 LUFS; bed music “Critical Thinking” (YouTube Audio Library) at -32 LUFS. Add subtle click SFX when showing UI toggles.  
- Captions: Provide context for policy references; export `video-12-ai-filters-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- Tech & Society template.  
- Option A: “AI is Editing You” with robot hand + crossed-out content.  
- Option B: “Invisible Moderators” with blurred feed background.  
- Save to `/assets/thumbnails/video-12/` and make 320 × 180 preview.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- TODO metadata `docs/work/epic-2/metadata/video-12-metadata.md` with keywords “AI moderation India”, “algorithmic transparency”, “IT Rules 2023”.  
- Upload master `video-12-ai-content-filters_4k.mp4` (H.264, 32 Mbps); upload Unlisted Friday 12:00 IST; schedule Friday 18:00 IST. End screen linking to Algorithm Bubbles and Tech & Society playlist.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter/X thread:** highlight 3 hidden AI decisions + call for transparency; include chart screenshot.  
- **LinkedIn:** Focus on compliance, brand safety, and fairness; tag MeitY, platform policy leads.  
- **Instagram Reel:** Quick “3 signs AI filtered your post” with call to watch full decode.

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- Engage with creators sharing demonetisation stories; gather anecdotes for follow-up.  
- Monitor view-through rate for Act 3 strategies to gauge interest in policy/actionable tips.  
- Track comment sentiment for potential community Q&A on algorithmic transparency.
