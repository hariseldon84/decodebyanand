# Emergency Backup Plan

> Use this playbook when publish-day issues arise. Prioritize transparency and consistency.

## Scenario A: Video Not Ready by Scheduled Publish
1. **Assess delay:** estimate completion time realistically (in hours).  
2. **Content buffer:**  
   - If buffer video exists (from batch), swap schedule immediately.  
   - If none, convert latest research into a 3-minute “Quick Decode” short; record via OBS same day.  
3. **Communication:**  
   - Update YouTube Community tab + Twitter with brief note (“Video pushed to [new time] to polish quality”).  
   - DM core supporters (Discord/WhatsApp) if applicable.  
4. **Reschedule:** adjust YouTube schedule to new slot (ideally <48h delay).  
5. **Retro:** log root cause in Notion (scope creep, tech issue, health) to prevent recurrence.

## Scenario B: Upload Failure / Technical Glitch
1. Retry upload after clearing browser cache; switch browser if repeated.  
2. Compress backup export (1080p) if bandwidth is the issue; upgrade later when stable.  
3. If YouTube outage suspected, check status dashboard + social channels; wait before reattempt.  
4. Keep video unlisted until QC completed again to ensure no corruption from re-encode.  
5. Document issue with timestamps and resolution steps.

## Scenario C: Critical Error Found Post-Publish
1. **Within 60 minutes:** set video to Private, re-export fix, re-upload, reapply metadata, and notify viewers via pinned comment/community post once live again.  
2. **After 60 minutes:** if issue minor (typo, small audio hiccup), leave video live; pin correction comment + update description.  
3. **Major factual error:** make video private, issue apology note, commit to follow-up clarification segment; consider re-upload with “Corrected” tag in title.

## Scenario D: Personal Emergency / Unable to Moderate
1. Inform backup moderator with quick brief + moderation guide.  
2. If no backup, post community note explaining moderation pause; disable comments temporarily if topic likely to attract harmful discourse.  
3. Resume normal operations ASAP; review queued comments for toxicity before re-enabling.

## Communication Templates
- **Delay Notice:** “Quick update: today’s decode needs a few extra hours of polish. We’re shifting the premiere to [time]. Thanks for sticking with quality-first storytelling.”  
- **Correction Post:** “We spotted an error in [section]. The updated version is live and the correction is detailed in the description. Appreciate everyone who flagged it.”  
- **Service Outage:** “YouTube upload is encountering issues platform-wide. We’ll monitor and keep you posted once the video is safely scheduled.”

## Documentation
- Maintain incident log (date, issue, resolution, follow-up action) inside Notion/analytics workspace.  
- Review incidents monthly to adjust buffers, tooling, or staffing.
