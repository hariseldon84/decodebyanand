# Video 27 Work: "AI Military Strategy"

## Research & Script Status
- Script: `epic-2/fullscripts/video-27-ai-military-strategy.md` — 2,350-word overview of AI-enabled warfare and India’s strategy.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `epic-2/research-notes/video-27-ai-military.md` compiling JADC2 updates, China doctrine, Indian defence AI projects, iDEX case studies, and relevant ethics guidelines.
- Validation: Check latest DAIPA initiatives, DRDO/Service announcements, UN CCW debates before recording; gather visuals of AI military projects.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** OBS profile `Decode_DefTech`; background split with tactical grid and drone imagery. Frame Obsbot Tiny 2 slightly right to leave left side for map/diagram overlays.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano cardioid, gain 10 o’clock; high-pass 80 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (-18 dB), limiter -3 dB. Capture room tone.
- **Lighting:** Cool-toned lighting with subtle red accent to evoke command center feel. White balance 4800K.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva graphics (AI warfare domains, India initiatives, playbook), timeline of AI defence milestones, global comparison chart. Export to `assets/graphics/video-27/`.
- **B-Roll:** Footage of drones, command centers, battlefield simulations, defence expos; screen captures of policy documents, AI dashboards. Ensure compliance with open-source licensing.

## Recording Plan
1. Rehearse script for clear articulation of acronyms and policy references.  
2. Record two VO takes; emphasise cautionary tone when discussing autonomy/ethics.  
3. Export WAVs; Audacity noise reduction + slight compression.  
4. Capture screen walkthroughs of charts, maps, doctrinal statements.  
5. Store assets `/videos/raw/video-27/{voiceover,screen,broll}/`; maintain cue sheet for editor.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- 4K timeline, 25 fps.  
- Use overlay animations (grid lines, radar sweeps) to illustrate battle network.  
- Color grade: cool contrast with mild vignette.  
- Audio: Normalize VO to -16 LUFS; bed track “Strategic Pulse” (YouTube Audio Library) at -30 LUFS. Insert subtle SFX (radar ping, drone hum) sparingly.  
- Captions: Ensure military terms accurate; export `video-27-ai-military-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- Geopolitics palette; highlight AI vs military iconography.  
- Option A: “AI Commands the Battlefield?”; Option B: “Autonomous Warfare”.  
- Save PNG to `assets/thumbnails/video-27/`; create 320 × 180 preview.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- TODO metadata `epic-2/metadata/video-27-metadata.md` (keywords: AI warfare India, autonomous weapons, defence AI strategy).  
- Upload plan: export master `video-27-ai-military_4k.mp4` (H.264, 32 Mbps); upload Unlisted Friday 11:00 IST; schedule Friday 18:00 IST. End screen linking to Nation States vs Tech Corporations and Geopolitics playlist.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter/X thread:** highlight key domains, India initiatives, ethics charter; poll “Should India deploy autonomous weapons?”  
- **LinkedIn:** strategy take for defence industry; tag MoD, DRDO, iDEX startups, Quad partners.  
- **Instagram carousel:** AI domains, India response, ethical guardrails, action steps; Reel with drone footage overlay.

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- Monitor defence experts’ reactions; capture points for future episodes.  
- Analytics: track engagement on ethics segment; adjust tone in related videos.  
- Update analytics tracker with production details once video is live.
