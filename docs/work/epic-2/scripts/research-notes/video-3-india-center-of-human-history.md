## Narrative Threads
- **Thread 1 – Evidence vs Narrative:** Archaeology and genetics vs civilizational myths positioning India as humanity’s core.  
- **Thread 2 – Cultural Memory:** How myths preserve historical kernels (trade networks, climatic events) while evolving into cosmology.  
- **Thread 3 – Responsible Storytelling:** Present multiple perspectives, outline disclaimers, propose moderation strategy for sensitive debate.

## Data & Quotes
- `{H3}` Rakhigarhi excavation confirming urban planning timeline.  
- `{H4}` NIOT study suggests submergence around 1500 BCE, contested.  
- `{H5}` Linguistic timeline placing Proto-Indo-European origin outside subcontinent.  
- `{H8}` Genetic admixture between Steppe pastoralists and Indus Valley groups 2000-1000 BCE.  
- `{H10}` Pew survey data on belief in epics as history.

## Visual & B-Roll Ideas
- Canva map overlay showing Harappan sites vs epic locations with gradient timeline.  
- OBS capture of genetic admixture chart from Narasimhan et al. (redraw for clarity).  
- iPhone footage of Indian texts, archaeological artifacts (books, replicas), temple bas reliefs.

## Fact-Check Flags
- [ ] Verify NIOT Dwarka claims with independent peer-reviewed critique to avoid overstating.  
- [ ] Present Out-of-India hypothesis alongside mainstream consensus without dismissive tone.

## Open Items
- [ ] Draft moderation responses for contentious comments (communal sensitivity, pseudo-history).  
- [ ] Include disclaimer slide text referencing acceptance criteria.
