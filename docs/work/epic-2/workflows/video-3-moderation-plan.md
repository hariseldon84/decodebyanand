# Video 3 Moderation Plan – "India as the Center of Human History?"

## Objectives
- Maintain respectful discourse on a sensitive topic blending mythology, religion, and history.
- Encourage evidence-backed debate while preventing communal hostility or misinformation.
- Document escalation paths for comments across YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, and Instagram.

## Moderation Roles
- **Primary Moderator:** Anand (owner account).  
- **Backup Moderator:** Trusted collaborator (assign before publish).  
- **Response SLA:**  
  - First 12 hours: check comments every 60 minutes.  
  - 12–48 hours: check thrice daily.  
  - After 48 hours: daily scan for 1 week.

## Comment Buckets & Actions
| Category | Example | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A. Respectful Debate | “Narasimhan study ignores indigenous sources.” | Reply with sources, invite further reading, pin if high value. |
| B. Misinformation | “NASA proved Ram Setu is man-made.” | Respond with fact-check link; clarify speculation label. |
| C. Off-topic Promotion | Link spam, channel plugs. | Remove quietly. |
| D. Hate Speech / Communal Slur | “People from X community lie about history.” | Remove + block + report. |
| E. Conspiracy / Disinformation | “Government hides proof of 10,000 BCE city.” | Request evidence; if none, remove after one follow-up. |

## Pre-Written Responses
- **Evidence Invitation:** “Appreciate the passion. Could you share a source we can all read? I’ve linked [H5] for linguistic timelines; happy to review alternatives.”  
- **Speculation Reminder:** “This section was marked speculative in the video. We’re open to new data—please add citations so we can evaluate together.”  
- **Civility Nudge:** “Let’s keep critiques focused on ideas, not identities. Community guidelines are linked in the description.”  
- **Misinformation Correction:** “NASA’s statement clarified the formation is natural (see XYZ link). The video references NIOT’s study and labels it as debated.”  
- **Sign-off for Heated Threads:** “Closing this thread to cool down. Feel free to DM sources; we’ll revisit in a future update if new evidence emerges.”

## Platform Notes
- **YouTube:** Pin top-level comment reinforcing guidelines; hide analytics-suspicious accounts promptly.  
- **Twitter/X:** Use thread with sources; mute abusive replies and screenshot key debates for documentation.  
- **LinkedIn:** Be mindful of professional tone; delete comments violating hate speech policy.  
- **Instagram:** Use question sticker to channel sentiment; respond to DMs with template disclaimers.

## Escalation & Documentation
- Log removed comments (screenshot + reason) in private Notion page for transparency.  
- If topic trends into communal tension, publish community post reiterating channel’s evidence-first stance and link to moderation policy.  
- Major misinformation incidents trigger follow-up short video or community post clarifying facts.

## Post-Mortem
- After 7 days, review top 20 comments, categorize, and note improvements for future controversial episodes.  
- Update this plan with new FAQs or recurring points raised by viewers.
