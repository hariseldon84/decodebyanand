## Opening Hook (0:00-0:30) | ~70 words
Imagine India slapping 25% tariffs on Chinese electronics, 35% on European cars, conditioning farm imports on “Buy Indian” rules, and launching subsidies rivaling the US Inflation Reduction Act. Factories cheer—but what happens to inflation, alliances, startups, and farmers? Tonight we run the scenario: India goes full US-style protectionist. Who wins, who pays, and is there a smarter path?

## Introduction (0:30-1:30) | ~220 words
The United States is deploying aggressive industrial policy—tariffs, export controls, subsidies—to claw back manufacturing. India already experiments with selective protection: PLI schemes, customs hikes, import licensing. But what if New Delhi adopted a wholesale US-style playbook—across steel, semiconductors, green tech, agriculture? Beyond headlines, this shift would ripple through consumer prices, export markets, diplomacy, and domestic competition.

In this decode we explore a hypothetical but plausible pivot. Act 1 sketches the US protectionist model—Section 232/301 tariffs, the Inflation Reduction Act, CHIPS Act—and maps how they work. Act 2 transposes that model onto India, sector by sector. Act 3 distills lessons to craft an “India-first competitiveness” strategy without self-sabotage.

## Act 1 – Decoding US Protectionism (1:30-6:00) | ~780 words
### Toolkit Overview
- **Tariffs & Quotas:** Section 232 (national security) and Section 301 (unfair trade) duties; steel/aluminium tariffs, China-specific tariffs. Quotas (TRQs) on allies.  
- **Subsidies & Tax Credits:** Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) offers $369B in clean-energy credits with domestic content conditions; CHIPS Act invests $52B in fab incentives.  
- **Export Controls:** Restrictions on advanced semiconductors/software to China, reinforcing domestic advantage.  
- **Buy American provisions:** Federal procurement preferring US-made goods; local content rules in EV tax credits.

### Outcomes
- US manufacturing construction spending surged 75% (2023 vs 2021) {S1}.  
- EV supply chains localizing, but consumer prices rose; inflation persisted until supply adjusted.  
- Allies frustrated—EU/Canada negotiated carve-outs; China retaliated.  
- WTO cases stalled; the US prioritised domestic resilience over multilateralism.

### Critiques
- Risk of inefficiency: subsidies may favour political picks.  
- Tariffs increase input costs for downstream industries; some US companies petition for exclusions.  
- Environmental goals sometimes clash with protectionism (e.g., limited access to global EV components).

## Act 2 – India Copies the Playbook (6:00-11:30) | ~840 words
### Scenario Setup
The Government of India announces “Sashakt Bharat Act”:
- Across-the-board 25% tariff on Chinese electronics, chemicals; 20% on auto imports; 30% on edible oil.  
- $200B subsidy package for batteries, semiconductors, green hydrogen, agri-processing with strict local content rules.  
- Export controls on critical minerals and pharma APIs.  
- Buy-Indian mandates for government procurement.

### Sector Impacts
1. **Consumer Electronics:** Domestic brands (Micromax revival, Lava) gain share; multinationals increase India assembly. Short-term prices jump 15–20%. Grey market reappears; smuggling via ASEAN rises.  
2. **Automotive & EVs:** Imported EVs price spike; Tesla pulls back. Domestic majors benefit but depend on imported cells—forcing faster localization.  
3. **Agriculture:** Edible oil tariffs boost domestic oilseeds but raise cooking oil prices; inflation hits households. Pulses imports restricted causing price spikes unless productivity rises.  
4. **Pharma & APIs:** Export controls to ensure domestic supply anger global partners; US/EU threaten retaliatory tariffs on generic drugs.  
5. **Renewables:** Subsidies accelerate domestic solar manufacturing, but domestic content rules risk WTO disputes.

### Macro Effects
- Inflation climbs 1.5–2 percentage points initially {S2}.  
- Fiscal deficit widens due to subsidies; rating agencies scrutinize debt sustainability.  
- Trade partners (US, EU, ASEAN) threaten retaliation; FTA talks stall.  
- Foreign investors weigh market access vs policy risk; some shift to Vietnam/Indonesia.

### Strategic Upside
- Local manufacturing booms if policy executed well; supply chain resilience improves.  
- Jobs surge in targeted sectors; technology transfer accelerates.  
- India positions as “third pole” in global manufacturing next to US/EU vs China.

### Risks
- Consumer welfare declines; inequality widens as low-income households bear higher prices.  
- Innovation suffers if markets insular; competition dwindles.  
- Diplomacy: Allies view India as unreliable partner; Quad coordination strained.  
- WTO compliance: broad tariffs risk disputes; India may argue “strategic autonomy” but faces countermeasures.

## Act 3 – Crafting an Indian Strategy (11:30-16:00) | ~780 words
### 1. Focused Tariffs, Not Blanket Walls
Target critical sectors (semiconductors, batteries, clean tech) with temporary tariffs tied to productivity milestones. Use tariff sunset clauses and performance audits.

### 2. Smart Subsidies
Design PLI 2.0 with outcome-based disbursement, transparency dashboards, and open competition (foreign + domestic). Prioritize R&D, skilling, and ecosystem building, not just capex.

### 3. Consumer Protection
Mitigate inflation via targeted cash transfers, GST tweaks, and phased tariff increases. Monitor essential goods; keep edible oil, pulses balanced with strategic reserves.

### 4. Trade Diplomacy
Negotiate carve-outs—mutual recognition of industrial policy—to avoid retaliation. Offer market access in services in exchange for manufacturing incentives. Pursue plurilateral “trusted supply chain” pacts.

### 5. Innovation & Competition
Mandate competition policies to prevent oligopolies. Encourage MSME participation via supplier diversity programs. Fund public research labs to complement private investment.

### 6. Data & Monitoring
Establish a Tariff-Impact Dashboard integrating customs data, inflation, employment, supply chain metrics. Empower NITI Aayog to recommend policy adjustments quarterly.

### 7. Safety Nets & Reskilling
Deploy reskilling funds for sectors hurt by retaliation (IT services in EU? Textile exporters). Strengthen social security (ESIC, E-Shram) for displaced workers.

## Conclusion (16:00-17:15) | ~210 words
Protectionism can catalyse manufacturing, but heavy-handed copy-pasting of the US model could hurt consumers, allies, and innovation. India needs a calibrated strategy rooted in competitiveness, not isolation. Strategic tariffs, smart subsidies, consumer safeguards, and proactive diplomacy can deliver resilience without self-inflicted wounds.
