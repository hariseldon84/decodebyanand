# Video 28 Work: "AI Served Humans vs Algorithms"

## Research & Script Status
- Script: `epic-2/fullscripts/video-28-ai-served-humans-vs-algorithms.md` — 2,250-word examination of human-centric vs algorithm-centric AI design.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `epic-2/research-notes/video-28-ai-served-vs-algorithms.md` gathering studies on mental health, dark patterns, algorithmic influence, and Indian policy drafts.
- Validation: Refresh ICMR mental health data, dark pattern regulation status, platform transparency reports before recording.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** OBS profile `Decode_HumanAlgorithm`; split background with human silhouette on one side, neural network on the other. Frame Obsbot Tiny 2 center.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano cardioid, gain 10 o’clock; high-pass 80 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (-18 dB), limiter -3 dB. Capture room tone.
- **Lighting:** Dual-tone lighting (warm for human side, cool for algorithm) to reinforce theme; white balance 4900K.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva graphics showing engagement loops, user controls, policy frameworks, playbook steps. Export to `assets/graphics/video-28/`.
- **B-Roll:** Record screen captures of social feeds, settings panels, wellbeing apps; gather stock footage of people interacting with devices, mindfulness practices.

## Recording Plan
1. Table-read emphasising balanced tone between warnings and solutions.
2. Record two VO takes; pronounce policy names clearly.
3. Export WAVs; Audacity noise reduction + slight warmth EQ.
4. Capture screen walkthroughs illustrating control toggles, policy documents, design examples.
5. Store assets `/videos/raw/video-28/{voiceover,screen,broll}/`; document asset map.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- 4K timeline, 25 fps.
- Use transitions swapping between human-centric and algorithm-centric visuals; highlight quotes from experts.
- Color grade: warm-cool contrast.
- Audio: Normalize VO to -16 LUFS; bed track “Mindful Pulse” (YouTube Audio Library) at -32 LUFS. Add subtle notification sounds and chimes when presenting solutions.
- Captions: Ensure policy terminology accurate; export `video-28-ai-humans-vs-algorithms-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- Tech & Society palette.
- Option A: “Are You Serving the Algorithm?”; Option B: “Take Back Your Feed.”
- Save PNG to `assets/thumbnails/video-28/`; create 320 × 180 preview.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- TODO metadata `epic-2/metadata/video-28-metadata.md` (keywords: algorithmic addiction, human-centric AI, digital wellbeing India).
- Upload plan: export master `video-28-ai-humans-algorithms_4k.mp4` (H.264, 32 Mbps); upload Unlisted Wednesday 12:00 IST; schedule Wednesday 18:00 IST. End screen linking to Algorithm Bubbles and Tech & Society playlist.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter/X thread:** contrast two design philosophies, share wellbeing tips, ask viewers for algorithm control hacks.
- **LinkedIn:** highlight human-centric design practices; tag Indian startups, product leads, policy makers.
- **Instagram carousel:** Problem, algorithm traps, human-centric design examples, personal playbook, CTA; Reel with dramatic hook.

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- Track viewer feedback on wellbeing tips; consider follow-up resources (digital detox guide).
- Analytics: observe retention during solution segment; adjust future behaviour-change content accordingly.
- Update analytics tracker with time spent and sentiment once video goes live.
