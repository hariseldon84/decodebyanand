# Video 4 Work: "We Are Living in a Simulation"

## Research & Script Status
- Script: `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/fullscripts/video-4-we-are-living-in-a-simulation.md` — 2,500-word draft with `{S#}` citations, act-level visual beats, and philosophical comparisons.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/research-notes/video-4-we-are-living-in-a-simulation.md` to log physics papers (Bostrom, Penrose, Narasimhan) and Indian philosophy references; include checklist for speculative/disclaimer accuracy.
- Validation: Confirm Indian quantum mission funding numbers (S19) 48 hours pre-recording and collect updated quotes from ISRO or MeitY releases if available.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** Load OBS profile `Decode_Indigo`; set 4K canvas, 25 fps, indigo gradient background with subtle particle overlay. Position Obsbot Tiny 2 slightly off-center for conversational framing.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano in cardioid, gain ~11 o’clock; OBS filters — high-pass 80 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (ratio 3:1), limiter -3 dB. Capture 30 s room tone for Audacity cleanup.
- **Lighting:** Cool-toned desk lamp bounced off white foam board to emphasise indigo palette; adjust white balance to ~5000K in OBS to avoid overly warm skin tones.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva slides for simulation timeline, quantum experiment diagrams, maya vs simulation comparison table. Export 16:9 PNGs to `assets/graphics/video-4/`. Prepare overlay lower thirds for “Speculative” disclaimers.
- **B-Roll:** Record OBS screen captures of Bostrom paper, IBM quantum roadmap, Indian quantum mission press release. Shoot iPhone 15 footage of VR headset usage, meditation shots for philosophical bridge. Keep 5-second handles.

## Recording Plan
1. Table-read the script noting pauses around Act 2 philosophical sections; mark emphasis for disclaimer lines.  
2. Record primary take in OBS “Audio Only” scene; capture backup on Voice Memos as redundancy.  
3. Export WAV (`video-4_VO_take1.wav`) and run gentle noise reduction in Audacity (profile from room tone).  
4. Capture screen walkthroughs of Canva visuals and research PDFs; maintain cursor discipline.  
5. Store assets in `/videos/raw/video-4/{voiceover,screen,broll}/`; log filenames in Notion tracker.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- Sequence: 3840 × 2160, 25 fps, 48 kHz audio.  
- Lay VO first, then layer visuals with animated zooms every 12–15 seconds.  
- Insert intro/outro from Story 1.6 with Science & Philosophy color variant.  
- Color correction: Lumetri basic — WB eyedrop, contrast +5, vibrance +8 to enhance indigo scenes.  
- Audio: Normalize VO to -16 LUFS; bed music “Mystic Path” (YouTube Audio Library) at -28 LUFS; add subtle synth swells at act transitions.  
- Graphics: Essential Graphics template for “Speculative” badge; apply on lines referencing unproven hypotheses.  
- Captions: Generate via Premiere Speech to Text; pay attention to Sanskrit terms (maya, lila); export SRT `video-4-simulation-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- Pillar template: Science & Philosophy indigo theme from Story 1.7.  
- Option A text: “Are We Simulated?”; Option B: “Reality = Code?”  
- Subject: mid-shot with contemplative pose, cyan glow rim-light effect in Canva.  
- Export PNG (1280 × 720, <2 MB) to `/assets/thumbnails/video-4/`; produce 320 × 180 preview for mobile QC.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- Draft metadata file `docs/work/epic-2/metadata/video-4-metadata.md` (TODO). Include keywords “simulation hypothesis”, “maya”, “quantum physics India”.  
- Upload plan:  
  1. Export master `video-4-simulation_4k.mp4` (H.264, 35 Mbps).  
  2. Upload as Unlisted Saturday 12:00 IST; attach captions, Option A thumbnail, metadata.  
  3. Schedule for Monday 18:00 IST (replace Video 4 slot in batch calendar).  
  4. Configure end screen: Subscribe, Latest upload, Science & Philosophy playlist.  
  5. Add chapters aligning with act structure.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter/X thread (5 tweets):** hook question, Bostrom statistic, Indian philosophy angle, quantum mission reference, CTA to comment if life is simulation.  
- **LinkedIn post:** highlight Indian philosophical contribution to global debate; tag IIT Madras, MeitY’s Quantum Mission team.  
- **Instagram Reel:** 20 s vertical clip summarizing Act 3 takeaway with “Speculative” badge overlay; caption poll “Simulation or Reality?”

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- First 24 h: respond to high-effort comments; pin best counterargument with respectful framing.  
- Analytics to watch: retention drop around Act 2 (philosophy) vs Act 1 (science). Note if disclaimers impact engagement.  
- Capture viewer questions for follow-up Q&A short; log metrics in analytics tracker for comparison with Video 5.
