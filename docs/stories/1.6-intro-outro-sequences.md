### Important Notes

1. **Prerequisites:** Story 1.2 (brand identity with logo files)
2. **Keep Short:** Viewers skip long intros - 5-7 seconds is ideal
3. **Transparency:** Alpha channel export allows flexibility for different backgrounds
4. **Template Value:** Pre-loaded project template saves 5-10 minutes per video
5. **Music Licensing:** Only use YouTube Audio Library or licensed music
