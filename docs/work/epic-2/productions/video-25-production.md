# Video 25 Work: "Cancer Cure Frontiers"

## Research & Script Status
- Script: `epic-2/fullscripts/video-25-cancer-cure-frontiers.md` — 2,400-word overview of cutting-edge cancer treatments and India’s roadmap.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `epic-2/research-notes/video-25-cancer-frontiers.md` capturing CAR-T trials, mRNA initiatives, precision oncology data, cost stats, and policy programs (Ayushman Bharat coverage).
- Validation: Update CAR-T pricing, ongoing trials (NexCAR19 rollout), regulatory updates, and screening statistics before recording.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** OBS profile `Decode_Oncology`; background showing DNA helix blending into hospital imagery. Frame Obsbot Tiny 2 center; keep space for data callouts.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano cardioid, gain 10 o’clock; high-pass 80 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (-18 dB), limiter -3 dB. Capture room tone.
- **Lighting:** Balanced, clinical but warm lighting to convey hope; white balance 5000K.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva graphics (global vs India breakthroughs, cost comparisons, trial pipeline timeline, access playbook). Export to `assets/graphics/video-25/`. Prepare patient journey diagram.
- **B-Roll:** Gather footage of labs, cell therapy manufacturing, hospital wards, community screenings; screen capture press releases and data dashboards. Ensure patient privacy compliance.

## Recording Plan
1. Rehearse script to handle technical terms clearly; emphasise hope + realism.  
2. Record two VO takes; confirm pronunciation (CAR-T, CRISPR, proton).  
3. Export WAVs; Audacity noise reduction + gentle compression.  
4. Capture screen walkthroughs for charts and roadmap steps.  
5. Store assets `/videos/raw/video-25/{voiceover,screen,broll}/`; maintain doc mapping visuals to script.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- 4K timeline, 25 fps.  
- Structure: Hook montage (lab + patient) → Act 1 breakthroughs → Act 2 barriers → Act 3 blueprint.  
- Color grade: clean, high-key visuals; boost saturation in hope segments.  
- Audio: Normalize VO to -16 LUFS; bed track “Hopeful Horizons” (YouTube Audio Library) at -32 LUFS. Add subtle heartbeat SFX during key data points.  
- Captions: Double-check medical terminology; export `video-25-cancer-frontiers-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- Science & Philosophy indigo palette.  
- Option A: “Cancer Cure Frontiers” with DNA helix; Option B: “Breakthroughs vs Barriers” split visual.  
- Save PNG to `assets/thumbnails/video-25/`; create mobile preview.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- TODO metadata `epic-2/metadata/video-25-metadata.md` (keywords: CAR-T India, cancer research, affordable oncology).  
- Upload plan: export master `video-25-cancer-frontiers_4k.mp4` (H.264, 32 Mbps); upload Unlisted Wednesday 10:00 IST; schedule Wednesday 18:00 IST. End screen linking to Boundaries of Knowledge episode and Science & Philosophy playlist.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter/X:** Thread with infographic of breakthroughs + India initiatives; CTA asking for stories of access challenges.  
- **LinkedIn:** Policy/industry angle; tag DBT, Tata Memorial, biotech startups, health insurers.  
- **Instagram carousel:** Breakthroughs, cost challenge, success stories, playbook, CTA; Reel snippet showcasing CAR-T lab visuals.

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- Monitor feedback from medical professionals; collect questions for Q&A follow-up.  
- Analytics: track retention during Act 2 (barriers) to ensure pacing engaging.  
- Record production hours and viewer sentiment in analytics tracker after release.
