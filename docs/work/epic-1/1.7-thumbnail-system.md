# Story 1.7 Work: Thumbnail Template System

## Global Design Framework
- **Canvas:** 1280 × 720 px, 200 dpi. Establish 12-column grid (80 px columns, 20 px gutters) with 60 px outer margin.  
- **Typography:** Montserrat Black uppercase for main phrase (max 4 words, 90–120 pt); Inter Medium 42 pt for supporting kicker if required.  
- **Focal Zone:** Keep subject face or hero object within center 640 × 480 px to avoid UI overlays.  
- **Logo Placement:** `d|a` monogram in bottom-right 120 × 120 px circle with charcoal drop shadow at 20% opacity.  
- **Depth:** Use glow or stroke (4–6 px) around cut-out subject to separate from background; add digital cyan rim glow for consistency.  
- **Mobile Test:** Downscale to 320 × 180 px before export to confirm legibility; adjust kerning until letters remain distinct.

## Pillar Templates
| Pillar | Color Lead | Layout Notes | Accent Elements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| India’s Future | Saffron gradient `#FF6D00 → #D84315` | Left-aligned subject, right-aligned text block; add diagonal bars referencing infrastructure | Overlay map outline of India at 10% opacity; gold spark icons near text |
| Tech & Society | Electric Cyan `#00E5FF` on charcoal background | Split layout: subject right, text left; digital grid texture | Add glitch scan lines (white 20% opacity); include small circuit icon near headline |
| Science & Philosophy | Deep Indigo `#1A237E` with light indigo vignette | Centered subject, text at top in curved arc | Include abstract orbit rings in cyan; place equation snippet (e.g., Schrödinger) blurred behind |
| Geopolitics & Economics | Dark charcoal base with gold `#FFD700` accent blocks | Triangular composition: subject left, text center, data viz card right | Insert simplified trade flow arrows in saffron; add flag silhouettes dimmed to 15% |

## Text Crafting Guardrails
- Maximum 12 characters per line; break long words to maintain 3-line max.  
- Use contrasting color pairs:  
  - Saffron template text in white with charcoal drop shadow (contrast 12.6:1).  
  - Cyan template text in charcoal (8.56:1).  
  - Indigo template text in white (13.24:1).  
  - Gold accent text in indigo (9.44:1).  
- Add urgency by pairing primary noun + verb (e.g., “RAILWAY RESET”, “AI WELFARE?”).

## File Organization & Naming
- Save Canva masters in `/assets/thumbnails/templates/` using `thumb-{pillar}-template-v1.canva`.  
- Each pillar folder includes grouped layers: `background`, `subject`, `text`, `accents`; color code groups for quick toggling.  
- Export final thumbnails to `/assets/thumbnails/final/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}-A.png`.

## A/B Testing Strategy
- Produce **Option A** (default pillar template) and **Option B** (variation adjusting color intensity or headline phrasing).  
- Upload primary thumbnail, schedule video, then swap to alternate after 24 h via YouTube “Test & Compare” (when available) or manual CTR comparison.  
- Track metrics in `analytics/monthly-reports/thumbnail-tests.csv` with columns: `video_id`, `pillar`, `option`, `impressions`, `ctr`, `watch_time`, `notes`.  
- Goal: Maintain CTR >4%; flag underperforming templates for redesign after three consecutive tests below threshold.

## Creation Workflow (Step-by-Step)
1. Duplicate appropriate pillar template; rename file with episode slug.  
2. Import subject photo; remove background; apply 110% scale and Canva glow effect tinted cyan.  
3. Update headline (max 4 words) and optional kicker; ensure kerning and line breaks align with grid.  
4. Adjust accent graphic (maps, circuits, equations) to support storyline; avoid clutter near bottom-right.  
5. Use Canva’s “Adjust → Sharpen” control (10–15) to maintain crispness after YouTube compression.  
6. Generate mobile preview at 320 × 180 px; tweak letter spacing or stroke until legible.  
7. Export PNG (sRGB, <2 MB) plus layered Canva backup.  
8. Produce variation B (change color grading, swap imagery, tweak phrasing).  
9. Record final settings (font size, color values, subject source) in `metadata/thumbnails/{slug}.md` for future reference.

## Review Checklist
- Headline readable at 320 × 180 px (no letters merging).  
- Subject eyes unobstructed; key facial features not covered by text.  
- Contrast ratio >4.5:1 between text and background.  
- Pillar color used as dominant; secondary colors limited to two additional hues.  
- Logo watermark visible but unobtrusive; opacity 85%.  
- Thumbnail passes “squint test” (reduce to 25% size on screen and verify clarity).
