### Repository Documentation

**Note:** This story does NOT require Git repository setup. That is covered in Story 1.5.
Current focus is YouTube platform configuration only.

### Important Notes

1. **Custom URL Eligibility:** Custom URL (@decodebyanand) requires 100 subscribers. If not immediately available, document fallback and plan to claim once eligible.
2. **No Code Implementation:** This story is entirely manual YouTube platform configuration. All work happens in YouTube Studio web interface.
3. **Documentation Location:** Create a `channel-setup-notes.md` file in the project documentation folder to record all configuration decisions.
4. **Security Critical:** 2FA is MANDATORY before any content is published. This is a security requirement, not optional.
