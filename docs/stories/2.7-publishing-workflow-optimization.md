## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Publishing Workflow Optimization:**
Reduce publishing time, improve consistency, minimize errors through checklists and automation
[Source: prd-section-5-epics-stories.md#story-2.7]

### Publishing Time Target

**Current:** 2-3 hours per video (manual, no standardization)
**Target:** <1 hour per video (with checklist + automation)
**Savings:** 1-2 hours per video = 8-16 hours per month (8 videos)
[Source: prd-section-5-epics-stories.md#story-2.7]

### Automation Opportunities

**YouTube Scheduled Uploads:**
- Upload 2 days in advance (Saturday for Monday publish)
- Allows final review before going live
- Reduces publish-day stress

**Social Media Scheduling:**
- Buffer or Later for Instagram scheduling
- Auto-create Twitter threads (Zapier integration possible)
- LinkedIn scheduled posts

**Caption Upload:**
- Bulk SRT upload faster than manual entry
- YouTube auto-caption + manual edit workflow
[Source: prd-section-5-epics-stories.md#story-2.7]

### Metadata Templates

**Title Formulas by Pillar:**
- Consistency aids SEO and brand recognition
- Primary keyword in first 5 words
- 60-70 characters (avoid truncation)

**Description Template:**
- First 150 characters show in search (optimize for keywords)
- Timestamps improve engagement and searchability
- Source citations build credibility
- Internal linking drives binge-watching

**Tag Lists:**
- 15-20 tags per pillar
- Mix of broad and specific tags
- Competitor tag analysis (what similar channels use)
[Source: prd-section-5-epics-stories.md#story-2.7]

### Quality Gates

**Pre-Publish Validation:**
1. **Audio:** -16 to -20 LUFS (LUFS meter check)
2. **Thumbnail:** Readable at 320x180 px (mobile preview)
3. **Captions:** >95% accurate (spot-check first 2 minutes)
[Source: prd-section-5-epics-stories.md#story-2.7]

### Emergency Backup Plan

**Video Not Ready:**
- Use 1-week content buffer (this is why buffer exists)
- Communicate delay if necessary (transparency builds trust)

**Upload Failures:**
- Retry with different browser/network
- Upload unlisted first, then schedule

**Post-Publish Errors:**
- Minor: Corrective comment + description update
- Major: Re-upload if <1 hour published
- Critical: Make private, fix, re-upload
