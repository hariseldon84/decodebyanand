# Story 2.2 Work: Video 1 – "Indian Startups High-Tech Gap"

## Research & Script Status
- Research notebook: `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/research-notes/video-1-indian-startups-high-tech-gap.md` with 10 sourced references, bias notes, and visual ideation.
- Production script: `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/examples/video-1-indian-startups-high-tech-gap.md` — 2,439 words aligned to template with `{S#}` citations, act-level visual beats, and OBS cues.
- Pending validation: verify S1 figures with one additional data source and refresh semiconductor incentive numbers 48 hours prior to recording.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** Configure OBS Studio with 4K canvas, 25 fps; load profile `Decode_A_Roll`. Frame Obsbot Tiny 2 at eye level, enable auto-framing with medium speed, disable face smoothing.  
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano in cardioid, gain dial ~10 o’clock, OBS audio filter stack → high-pass 80 Hz, noise suppression (RNNoise), limiter at -3 dB. Run 30 s room tone capture for Audacity cleaning template.  
- **Lighting:** Use existing room lighting plus desk lamp bounced off white foam board to soften shadows; white balance via manual Kelvin adjustment (set ~4800K) using OBS color correction filter.  
- **Visual Assets:** Create Canva deck (3840 × 2160) with sector bar chart, capital flow infographic, action list; export PNG slides to `assets/graphics/video-1/`. Capture DPIIT and UNESCO charts via OBS window capture with blur to hide personal data.  
- **B-Roll:** Shoot iPhone 15 footage (4K 30 fps, HDR off) of note-taking, PCB close-ups, and whiteboard diagrams; stabilize in Premiere if handheld.

## Recording Plan
1. Rehearse script once focusing on pacing around data-heavy sections (Acts 1 & 2).  
2. Record voiceover in OBS using "Audio Only" scene; perform two full takes, mark standout timestamps in notes.  
3. Export WAV masters (`VO_v1.wav`, `VO_v2.wav`) and run light noise reduction in Audacity (profile from room tone).  
4. Record screen walkthrough of Canva slides and data charts; maintain 5-second handles for edit flexibility.  
5. File storage: `/videos/raw/video-1/voiceover/`, `/videos/raw/video-1/screen/`, `/videos/raw/video-1/broll/` (create folders locally; mirror paths in Notion tracker).

## Editing Blueprint (Adobe Premiere Pro)
- Sequence: 3840 × 2160, 25 fps, audio at 48 kHz.  
- Assemble VO track first, then layer screen captures and B-roll with cuts every 10–15 seconds.  
- Apply intro/outro assets from Story 1.6; insert watermark (70% opacity) after 30 s mark.  
- Color correct using Lumetri: white balance eyedropper on grey card clip; lift shadows +10 to counter room lighting; mild saturation boost +5.  
- Audio: Loudness Match to -16 LUFS integrated, apply subtle multiband compression preset, music bed (YouTube Audio Library “Future Ambient 009”) at -24 LUFS sidechained beneath VO.  
- Captions: Generate auto-transcript in Premiere, review first 5 minutes thoroughly, export SRT `video-1-captions.srt`.  
- Quality pass: watch at 1.25x to catch jump cuts, verify text legibility, confirm CTA alignment with outro animation.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- Base template: `Tech & Society` layout from Story 1.7 adapted to Saffron dominant for India’s Future pillar.  
- Option A text: “Hard Tech Void”  
- Option B text: “Why India Imports Brains”  
- Subject: mid-shot from Obsbot capture; apply Canva glow tinted cyan + saffron gradient background with data grid overlay.  
- Export PNG (1280 × 720, <2 MB) to `/assets/thumbnails/video-1/`. Generate 320 × 180 preview to confirm readability.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- Metadata file: `docs/work/epic-2/metadata/video-1-metadata.md` (title, description, 20 tags, pin comment).  
- Upload workflow:  
  1. Export final master `video-1-high-tech-gap_4k.mp4` (H.264, 45 Mbps).  
  2. Upload to YouTube as Unlisted Saturday 18:00 IST; attach captions, Option A thumbnail, metadata contents.  
  3. Configure end screen (subscribe, latest video auto, India’s Future playlist).  
  4. Add chapters per description timestamps; schedule Monday 18:00 IST.  
  5. Prepare Option B thumbnail for manual A/B swap after 24 hours if CTR <4%.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter Thread (max 6 tweets):**  
  1. Hook question about India importing critical tech.  
  2. Data point (S1) + chart screenshot.  
  3. Capital bias insight (S2).  
  4. Policy lever highlight (S7).  
  5. CTA: link + poll asking which lever viewers would pull first.  
  6. Teaser for upcoming UPI episode.
- **LinkedIn Post:** 150-word summary emphasising economic sovereignty; tag MeitY, DPIIT, NASSCOM; attach thumbnail variant.  
- **Instagram Story:** 15-second vertical clip from Act 3 summary with caption sticker “Should India bet bigger on hard tech?” and link sticker (when eligible) or bio prompt.

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- First 24h: reply to initial 20 comments, pin best reflection.  
- Analytics watch: retention curve drop-off around 6-minute mark (transition between Acts 1 and 2); note for improvement.  
- Log metrics in Notion + prepare comparison table for Story 2.3 (CTR, retention, subs gained).
