# Video 19 Work: "Fossil Fuels → Renewables: India’s 2040 Flip"

## Research & Script Status
- Script: `epic-2/fullscripts/video-19-fossil-fuels-to-renewables.md` — 2,400-word roadmap for India’s energy transition.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `epic-2/research-notes/video-19-fossil-to-renewables.md` collecting CEA capacity data, coal imports, IEA outlook, MNRE pipeline, storage projects, and just transition studies.
- Validation: Update latest installation numbers, coal demand projections, and MNRE tender announcements before recording.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** OBS profile `Decode_GreenGrid`; background gradient with solar panels, wind turbines, and transmission lines. Frame Obsbot Tiny 2 center-right with space for charts on left.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano cardioid, gain 10 o’clock; high-pass 80 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (-18 dB), limiter -3 dB. Capture room tone.
- **Lighting:** Mixed daylight and warm fill to evoke sunrise/transition; white balance 5000K.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva infographics (capacity mix pie, transmission buildout timeline, storage mission, just transition map). Export to `assets/graphics/video-19/`. Prepare animation of fossil vs renewable share over time.
- **B-Roll:** Collect footage of solar farms, wind turbines, coal plants, battery factories; screen capture dashboards (CEA, MNRE). Ensure proper licensing.

## Recording Plan
1. Rehearse script to balance urgency with optimism; mark emphasis on numbers and human stories.  
2. Record two VO takes; ensure clarity on acronyms (MNRE, GEC, PLI).  
3. Export WAVs; Audacity noise reduction + gentle EQ.  
4. Capture screen walkthroughs of charts, energy dashboards, and roadmap slides.  
5. Store assets `/videos/raw/video-19/{voiceover,screen,broll}/` with shot list referencing script sections.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- 4K sequence, 25 fps.  
- Opening montage blending coal plant smoke with solar sunrise using cross dissolve.  
- Color grade: mild warm tone; heighten green saturation for renewable visuals.  
- Audio: Normalize VO to -16 LUFS; bed track “Renewed Hope” (YouTube Audio Library) at -32 LUFS. Add subtle wind/solar ambient SFX in transitions.  
- Captions: Ensure units and acronyms accurate; export `video-19-fossil-renewables-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- India’s Future palette (saffron + green).  
- Option A: “Coal to Clean” with split image (coal plant vs solar farm).  
- Option B: “India’s 2040 Energy Flip” with arrow graphic.  
- Save PNG to `assets/thumbnails/video-19/`; create 320 × 180 preview.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- TODO metadata `epic-2/metadata/video-19-metadata.md` (keywords: India energy transition, renewable roadmap, storage mission).  
- Upload plan: export master `video-19-fossil-renewables_4k.mp4` (H.264, 32 Mbps); upload Unlisted Wednesday 11:00 IST; schedule Wednesday 18:00 IST. End screen linking to Tariff Wars (industry impact) and Tech & Society energy playlist.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter/X thread:** capacity mix infographic, storage mission, just transition plan, call to action.  
- **LinkedIn:** policy + industry focus; tag MNRE, NTPC Green, ReNew Power, IEA.  
- **Instagram carousel:** Problem → Data → Storage Blitz → Community transition → Action list; Reel with solar-to-coal crossfade.

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- Gather viewer feedback on local transition projects; compile resources for newsletter.  
- Analytics: track retention around Act 2 (bottlenecks) to refine pacing.  
- Update efficiency log with production hours and topic notes once video releases.
