# Video 21 Work: "Nation States → Tech Corporations"

## Research & Script Status
- Script: `epic-2/fullscripts/video-21-nation-states-to-tech-corporations.md` — 2,400-word analysis of tech vs state power.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `epic-2/research-notes/video-21-nation-vs-tech.md` compiling case studies (India Big Tech clashes, EU DSA/DMA, US antitrust, China controls) and updated policy drafts (Digital India Act).
- Validation: Check latest regulatory developments, ongoing court cases (CCI vs Google/Amazon), new MeitY directives, platform compliance updates.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** OBS profile `Decode_PowerShift`; background split between parliament silhouette and skyscraper with tech logos. Frame Obsbot Tiny 2 center; reserve lower-thirds for case studies.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano cardioid, gain 10 o’clock; high-pass 80 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (-18 dB), limiter -3 dB. Capture room tone.
- **Lighting:** Dual-tone lighting (warm on state side, cool on tech side) to emphasize contrast. White balance 4900K.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva visuals—timeline of key flashpoints, matrix of control domains, India strategy playbook. Export to `assets/graphics/video-21/`. Prepare overlay icons for regulation, DPI, diplomacy.
- **B-Roll:** Collect clips of parliament sessions, tech HQs, press conferences, global news headlines. Screen record regulatory documents, ONDC demos, Apple/Google policies.

## Recording Plan
1. Rehearse to maintain balanced tone—critical but constructive.  
2. Record two VO takes; ensure clarity when referencing policies and acronyms (DSA, DMA, DPDP).  
3. Export WAVs; apply Audacity noise reduction + slight compression.  
4. Capture screen walkthroughs highlighting each flashpoint and action item.  
5. Store assets `/videos/raw/video-21/{voiceover,screen,broll}/` with shot list for editing.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- 4K timeline, 25 fps.  
- Employ split-screen transitions (state vs tech) and overlay headlines to dramatize.  
- Color grade: neutral with slight contrast to emphasize seriousness.  
- Audio: Normalize VO to -16 LUFS; background track “Strategic Horizon” (YouTube Audio Library) at -32 LUFS. Use subtle SFX when flipping between state/tech segments.  
- Captions: Ensure names and policies accurate; export `video-21-nation-tech-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- Tech & Society palette (charcoal/cyan).  
- Option A: “Who Governs You?” with dual icons; Option B: “State vs Big Tech” with tug-of-war graphic.  
- Save PNG to `assets/thumbnails/video-21/`; provide mobile preview.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- TODO metadata `epic-2/metadata/video-21-metadata.md` (keywords: digital sovereignty India, Big Tech regulation, DPI strategy).  
- Upload plan: export master `video-21-nation-vs-tech_4k.mp4` (H.264, 32 Mbps); upload Unlisted Wednesday 13:00 IST; schedule Wednesday 18:00 IST. End screen linking to Human Decisions → AI and Tech & Society playlist.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter/X:** Thread summarizing control domains and India’s toolkit; ask “Which platform feels more powerful than government?”  
- **LinkedIn:** Strategy brief for policymakers, corporate leaders; tag MeitY, CCI, ONDC, major platforms.  
- **Instagram carousel:** Hook, domains, flashpoints, playbook, CTA; Reel with quick state vs tech split.

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- Engage with policy analysts, digital rights groups; collect responses for follow-up.  
- Track retention across each act; note interest in DPI segments for future content.  
- Log production hours, metrics after release in efficiency tracker.
