# Video 24 Work: "Boundaries to Scientific Knowledge"

## Research & Script Status
- Script: `epic-2/fullscripts/video-24-boundaries-to-scientific-knowledge.md` — 2,300-word exploration of formal, practical, and ethical limits of science.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `epic-2/research-notes/video-24-boundaries-knowledge.md` covering Gödel, Heisenberg, chaos theory, computational complexity, philosophical essays, and Indian perspectives on knowledge limits.
- Validation: Update with latest breakthroughs (quantum gravity research, AI theorem proving), Indian projects (quantum mission) before recording; collect illustrative examples (weather forecasting horizons, AI limitations).

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** OBS profile `Decode_CosmosThink`; background starfield with geometric overlays (equations, wavefunctions). Frame Obsbot Tiny 2 center-left; leave space for quotes/equations to appear on right.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano cardioid, gain 10 o’clock; high-pass 80 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (-18 dB), limiter -3 dB. Record room tone.
- **Lighting:** Soft, contemplative lighting; cool fill to match philosophical theme. White balance 5000K.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva slides with key concepts (Gödel’s theorem, uncertainty, chaos diagrams, halting problem, ethical zone). Export to `assets/graphics/video-24/`. Prepare timeline of scientific paradigm shifts.
- **B-Roll:** Capture stock footage of labs, supercomputers, telescopes; animate equations; screen record visualisations (Lorenz attractor, quantum experiment animations). Ensure licensing.

## Recording Plan
1. Rehearse script emphasising clarity in technical sections; mark pauses for viewer reflection.  
2. Record two VO takes; ensure pronunciation for names (Gödel, Heisenberg, Chalmers).  
3. Export WAVs; treat with Audacity noise reduction + slight reverb (very subtle) for contemplative feel.  
4. Capture screen walkthroughs of diagrams and quotes.  
5. Store assets `/videos/raw/video-24/{voiceover,screen,broll}/`; track corresponding timestamps.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- 4K timeline, 25 fps.  
- Use slow zooms on visuals; overlay equations with fade effects.  
- Color grade: moderate cool tone; add vignette for focus.  
- Audio: Normalize VO to -16 LUFS; background track “Atmospheric Reflection” (YouTube Audio Library) at -32 LUFS. Add subtle chime SFX when introducing new limit concepts.  
- Captions: Ensure mathematical terminology spelled correctly; export `video-24-boundaries-knowledge-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- Science & Philosophy palette (indigo).  
- Option A: “Limits of Knowledge?” with silhouette + equations; Option B: “What We Can’t Know” cosmic graphic.  
- Save PNG to `assets/thumbnails/video-24/`; produce 320 × 180 preview.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- TODO metadata `epic-2/metadata/video-24-metadata.md` with keywords “limits of science”, “Gödel Heisenberg”, “philosophy of science India”.  
- Upload plan: export master `video-24-boundaries-knowledge_4k.mp4` (H.264, 30 Mbps); upload Unlisted Wednesday 12:00 IST; schedule Wednesday 18:00 IST. End screen linking to simulation video and Science & Philosophy playlist.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter/X thread:** highlight 4 limits (Gödel, uncertainty, chaos, ethics) + call-to-action question.  
- **LinkedIn:** post for researchers/educators emphasising humility and interdisciplinary approaches; tag academic institutions.  
- **Instagram carousel:** concept cards with quotes; Reel snippet featuring hook question.

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- Engage with scientists/philosophers sharing perspectives; curate for follow-up discussions.  
- Analytics: track retention at Act transitions; note viewer drop off on technical sections to fine-tune pacing.  
- Log production time and viewer sentiment in analytics tracker after release.
