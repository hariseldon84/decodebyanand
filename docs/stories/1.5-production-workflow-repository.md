### 3-2-1 Backup Strategy

**3 Copies:**
1. Working copy: Local laptop/desktop
2. Local backup: External SSD (2TB minimum)
3. Cloud backup: Google Drive (2TB subscription)

**2 Different Media:**
1. SSD (solid state, fast)
2. Cloud (Google Drive, geographically distributed)

**1 Offsite:**
- Google Drive servers (multiple data centers)

**Backup Automation:**
- Daily: Local â†’ External SSD (rsync/backup script)
- Daily: Local â†’ Google Drive (Google Drive app auto-sync)
- Weekly: Manual verification (spot-check random files)
- Monthly: Archive older videos (3+ months)

[Source: architecture.md#7.1-3-2-1-backup-strategy]

### Git Configuration

**Ignore Patterns:**
```
# Video files (too large for Git)
*.mp4
*.mov
*.avi

# Temporary files
*~
.DS_Store
*.tmp

# Editor backups
*.prproj.backup
*.drp.backup

# Cache and logs
*.log
cache/
```
[Source: architecture.md#4.3-version-control-strategy]

**Git LFS (Large File Storage):**
- Use for medium-sized assets (10-100MB)
- Design templates, audio beds
[Source: architecture.md#4.3-version-control-strategy]

### Important Notes

1. **Large Files:** Videos should NOT be committed to Git (use external SSD + Google Drive)
2. **Git LFS:** Optional for assets 10-100MB (PSD files, audio beds)
3. **Security:** Repository is private on GitHub
4. **Backup Critical:** 3-2-1 strategy is mandatory before publishing first video
5. **Templates:** Script and metadata templates save significant time per video
