# Story 2.4 Work: Video 3 – "India as the Center of Human History?"

## Research & Script Deliverables
- Research notes: `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/research-notes/video-3-india-center-of-human-history.md` with balanced source mix (ASI, NIOT, genetic studies, UNESCO, Pew).
- Script draft: `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/fullscripts/video-3-india-center-of-human-history.md` — 2,256 words, includes on-screen disclaimer, lens comparison, and moderation cues.
- Metadata: `docs/work/epic-2/metadata/video-3-metadata.md` with 240-word description highlighting multiple perspectives and moderated discourse expectations.

## Sensitivity & Compliance
- **Disclaimer:** Display within first 30 seconds (text + narration) emphasizing that speculative claims are labeled and respectful debate is required.
- **Moderation Plan:** `docs/work/epic-2/workflows/video-3-moderation-plan.md` details comment buckets, response templates, escalation, and logging.
- **Peer Review:** Recommend historian + cultural sensitivity check before recording; document feedback in script margin comments.
- **Visual Cueing:** Whenever speculative material appears (Dwarka submergence, yuga timelines), add orange “Speculative” badge in Premiere lower-third.

## Production Guidance
- **OBS Scene:** Duplicate `Decode_A_Roll` and adjust background lighting to indigo (Science & Philosophy palette). Use Canva overlay of star map subtly animated in OBS as background layer.  
- **Audio:** Maintain Blue Yeti Nano settings; consider light reverb to soften room since more contemplative tone.  
- **Visual Assets:**  
  - Canva maps showing Harappan sites vs epic locations.  
  - Redrawn genetic admixture chart (avoid showing raw paper to reduce clutter).  
  - Timeline of key milestones (Harappan peak, Vedic compilation, Nalanda).  
  - Moderation rules slide for Act 3.  
- **B-Roll:** iPhone footage of historical texts, replicas, museum souvenirs; ensure neutral framing to avoid denominational bias.

## Editing Notes
- Slow pacing with purposeful pauses around sensitive sections; target 105–110 WPM.  
- Insert lower-third definitions when referencing academic terms (e.g., “Admixture: blending of ancestral populations”).  
- Add subtle ambient pad background (YouTube Audio Library “Mystic Path” at -28 LUFS) to maintain contemplative mood.  
- Captions: pay attention to Sanskrit terms; add phonetic aids in brackets.  
- Color grade: indigo cast with gold accent for callouts, referencing Science & Philosophy pillar.  
- Outro to crossfade into moderation reminder card linking to community guidelines.

## Thumbnail Strategy
- Template: Science & Philosophy deep indigo with abstract orbit rings.  
- Option A text: “Myth or Memory?”  
- Option B text: “India’s Origin Debate”  
- Subject: mid-shot with contemplative expression; overlay faint manuscript texture.  
- Keep text white with charcoal drop shadow; highlight “Myth” or “Origin” in saffron.

## Publishing & Review
- Schedule Friday 18:00 IST. Set end screen to promote upcoming Aadhaar surveillance episode and Science & Philosophy playlist.  
- Create community post morning of release summarizing the three lenses and linking moderation policy.  
- During first 48 hours, monitor comments hourly per moderation plan; triage using pre-written responses.  
- After 7 days, compile top discussion threads and note future clarifications for Story 2.6 analytics review.
