# Video 6 Work: "What If India Colonized Britain?"

## Research & Script Status
- Script: `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/fullscripts/video-6-india-colonized-britain.md` — 2,400-word alternate history paired with strategic lessons for modern India.
- Research notebook: _Pending_. Create `docs/work/epic-2/scripts/research-notes/video-6-india-colonized-britain.md` to catalogue naval history references (Chola expeditions, Mughal artillery), economic data (Maddison, Broadberry), and modern naval plans.
- Fact check: Revisit Maritime Capability Perspective Plan stats (S9) and GDP share numbers (S5) for latest revisions; collect visuals for historical maps.

## Pre-Production Checklist
- **Scene Prep:** OBS profile `Decode_Saffron`; background map overlay of Indian Ocean with subtle animated routes. Frame Obsbot Tiny 2 slightly wider to allow on-screen map pop-outs.
- **Audio Chain:** Blue Yeti Nano cardioid, gain 11 o’clock; high-pass 70 Hz, RNNoise, compressor (-20 dB threshold), limiter -3 dB. Capture room tone.
- **Lighting:** Warm key light to complement saffron palette; bounce fill from left to avoid harsh shadows. White balance 4700K.
- **Visual Assets:** Canva alternate timeline maps, naval fleet infographics, strategy summary slide. Export PNGs to `assets/graphics/video-6/`. Prepare comparison charts (real vs alternate timeline).
- **B-Roll:** Gather public domain paintings/maps (British Library, Wikimedia) via OBS capture; shoot iPhone footage of globe spin, navy books, strategy whiteboard. Keep legal credit notes.

## Recording Plan
1. Rehearse emphasising timeline clarity to avoid confusion; mark 3-second pauses between acts.  
2. Record VO in two takes; pay attention to proper nouns (Panikkar, Rukmini).  
3. Export WAVs; Audacity noise reduction + de-esser (6 kHz) for crispness.  
4. Screen record map animations and timeline slides.  
5. Store in `/videos/raw/video-6/{voiceover,screen,broll}/`; update Notion with location references.

## Editing Blueprint (Premiere Pro)
- 4K sequence, 25 fps.  
- Use parallax effect on maps to create depth; animate dashed trade routes via Essential Graphics.  
- Insert alternate reality “flash” effect (glitch transition) when shifting between real and hypothetical segments.  
- Color: mild warm tone (Temperature +5).  
- Audio: Normalize to -16 LUFS; bed music “Epic Documentary” (YouTube Audio Library) at -26 LUFS, accent drums during Lesson sections.  
- Captions: Add context notes for historical names; export `video-6-colonized-britain-captions.srt`.

## Thumbnail & Branding
- India’s Future pillar template with saffron gradient.  
- Option A: “If India Ruled London” with Big Ben + India Gate mashup.  
- Option B: “Reverse Empire” with map overlay.  
Save to `/assets/thumbnails/video-6/` + 320 × 180 preview.

## Metadata & Scheduling
- Draft metadata `docs/work/epic-2/metadata/video-6-metadata.md` (todo) emphasising alternate history + strategy lessons.  
- Upload plan: export master `video-6-reverse-empire_4k.mp4` (H.264, 32 Mbps); upload Unlisted Friday 10:00 IST; schedule Friday 18:00 IST. End screen: Subscribe, India’s Future playlist, Video 7 teaser card.

## Social Distribution Copy
- **Twitter/X:** Thread summarizing timeline + 3 modern lessons; include map image.  
- **LinkedIn:** Focus on naval/financial strategy parallels; tag Indian Navy, GIFT City, SAGAR policy handles.  
- **Instagram Reel:** 20 s dramatized alt-history narration over map animation.

## Post-Publish Monitoring
- Watch for historical accuracy critiques; prepare sources for quick replies.  
- Track retention across Act 3 (lessons) to ensure viewers stay through strategy portion.  
- Compare CTR vs Video 5; adjust future alt-history packaging if drop observed.
