# Story 2.6 Work: Videos 8–10 & Analytics Deep Dive

## Production Outlook for Videos 8–10
- **Video 8 – Privacy → Surveillance (Aadhaar)**  
  - Pillar: Geopolitics & Economics.  
  - Angle: Balance between DPI-driven inclusion and surveillance risks; include DPDP Act, Supreme Court verdicts, data breach cases.  
  - Research leads: Justice Puttaswamy judgement, UIDAI whitepapers, Internet Freedom Foundation reports, World Bank DPI brief.  
  - Visual ideas: Flowchart of data flows, heat map of Aadhaar-linked services, Canva split of “Empower vs Monitor.”  

- **Video 9 – Secret Societies Pre-Independence**  
  - Pillar: India’s Future (historical lens).  
  - Angle: Networks like Anushilan Samiti, Indian National Army intelligence, clandestine student groups; highlight lessons for modern civic organizing.  
  - Sources: Bipan Chandra, Aparna Vaidik, National Archives microfilm, biographies of VD Savarkar/Subhas Bose.  
  - Visual ideas: Vintage documents, sepia-toned typography, timeline of secret operations.

- **Video 10 – Quantum Computing + Consciousness**  
  - Pillar: Science & Philosophy.  
  - Angle: Examine scientific progress (IISc, TIFR lab updates) and philosophical interpretations (Advaita, panpsychism), labeling speculation clearly.  
  - Sources: IBM and Google quantum roadmaps, Indian Quantum Mission updates, works by Penrose/Hameroff, Indian philosophy texts.  
  - Visuals: Canva quantum circuit diagrams, OBS capture of qubit simulator, abstract consciousness art.

Aim for <15 hours production per video using refined workflows from Stories 2.2–2.5.

## Analytics Deliverables
- **Performance Review Template:** `docs/work/epic-2/analytics/first-10-videos-review.md` — populate once Video 10 hits 72-hour mark. Include retention, CTR, engagement, and qualitative notes.  
- **Efficiency Log:** Extend `docs/work/epic-2/analytics/batch-production-efficiency.md` to include timings for Videos 8–10 (add rows once complete).  
- **Subscriber Tracking:** Capture baseline subs before Video 8, then per-video deltas. Record in review doc’s “Subscriber gain per video” column.

## Strategy Adjustments
- **Action Framework:** Use `docs/work/epic-2/workflows/content-strategy-v2.md` to document what topics, formats, and thumbnails performed best. Reference data points (e.g., “Video 5 CTR 5.6% due to question-headline format; replicate across Tech & Society uploads”).  
- **Next Slate Planning:** Populate `docs/work/epic-2/workflows/next-10-videos-plan.md` with selected ideas for Videos 11–20, referencing winning pillars and viewer requests.

## Data Collection Process
1. Export analytics CSV from YouTube Studio (Advanced Mode → Video-level metrics).  
2. Calculate retention by dividing average view duration by video length; confirm target >50%.  
3. Compare thumbnails (option A vs B) using data under “Experiments” tab. Note design differences.  
4. Analyze demographics (age, geography) to see if diaspora or Indian metros dominate; adapt scheduling and references accordingly.  
5. Identify segments causing drop-offs using audience retention graph (e.g., heavy statistic sections, long monologues). Document timestamp + hypothesis for improvement.

## Documentation & Reporting
- Schedule 2-hour analytics review block the Monday after Video 10 release.  
- Summarize key learnings in 3 bullets per section (topics, format, thumbnails, CTAs) and store in `content-strategy-v2.md`.  
- Present condensed recap in community post and Notion workspace; align with Epic 3 planning.  
- Track subscriber path to 1K goal: compute average subscribers gained per video and project timeline. Highlight videos contributing highest delta.

## Risk Mitigation
- Assign data backup: download analytics CSVs and store in `/analytics/raw/` (create folder) for reproducibility.  
- If retention dips below 45% on any video, schedule emergency retrospective to investigate.  
- Monitor social sentiment for Aadhaar episode closely (possible controversy); feed insights into strategy doc.
