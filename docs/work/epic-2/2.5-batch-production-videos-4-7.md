| Week 3 | Editing & Thumbnails | Premiere assembly, captions, audio mix, thumbnails, metadata | 32h total (~8h/video) |

## Script Blueprints (Week 1)
Use `docs/work/epic-2/templates/video-script-template.md` plus research template. Draft outlines below to accelerate writing sessions.

### Video 4 – We Are Living in a Simulation (Science & Philosophy)
- **Hook:** Probability paradox—Elon Musk vs Indian Vedantic analogs.  
- **Act Structure:**  
  1. Simulation theory basics (Nick Bostrom), parallels in Hindu/Buddhist cosmology.  
  2. Scientific arguments (computational limits, quantum weirdness, AI advancements).  
  3. Implications for ethics, policy, and Indian philosophical perspectives.  
- **Sources to pull:** Bostrom (2003), Chalmers (2022), IIT Madras Center for Quantum Computation, Upanishad references (Maya), Pew surveys on belief in simulated realities.  
- **Visual cues:** Canva renders of nested universes, OBS capture of code visualizations, iPhone B-roll of VR experiences.  
- **Notes:** Emphasize speculation disclaimers; include Indian philosophical lens to ground topic locally.

### Video 5 – Technology Makes Us Dumber (Tech & Society)
- **Hook:** Memory offloading to smartphones vs Gurukul rote tradition.  
- **Act Structure:**  
  1. Cognitive science on digital distraction (Stanford studies, Microsoft attention span research).  
  2. Counterexamples where tech augments cognition (spaced repetition apps, AI tutors).  
  3. Indian education context—NEP, digital classrooms, balancing analog+digital.  
- **Sources:** Sherry Turkle’s MIT work, NIMHANS studies on screen time, DIKSHA platform adoption data, Nasscom future of work reports.  
- **Visuals:** Chart of screen time vs retention, B-roll of note-taking analog vs digital, Canva scoreboard of “Augment vs Atrophy.”  
- **Angle:** Conclude with practical “digital minimalism” habits without moral panic.

### Video 6 – India Colonized Britain (History Reversed)
- **Hook:** Counterfactual scenario—what if Indian empires sailed first?  
- **Act Structure:**  
  1. Establish alternate timeline triggers (Chola maritime expansion continues, Mughal industrialization).  
  2. Imagined economic/political consequences for Britain and India.  
  3. Real-world lessons on industrial policy, naval power, and present-day strategy.  
- **Sources:** Naval history (KM Panikkar), economic data on Industrial Revolution, works on counterfactual history methodology (Niall Ferguson).  
- **Visuals:** Alternate history maps, Canva timeline comparing actual vs counterfactual milestones, B-roll of ship models/ports.  
- **Notes:** Clear disclaimers—fictional scenario used to derive strategic insights.

### Video 7 – Data as Real Estate (Tech & Society / Geopolitics)
- **Hook:** Data centers vs land banks—India’s next property boom.  
- **Act Structure:**  
  1. Define data as an asset (storage, governance, localization).  
  2. India’s policy push (Digital Personal Data Protection Act, data center incentives).  
  3. Global geopolitics—sovereignty, cross-border flows, opportunities for Indian states.  
- **Sources:** MeitY data center incentives, Brookings India papers, Cisco/Equinix reports, NASSCOM analytics.  
- **Visuals:** Heat map of data center pipeline, comparing energy usage, Canva infographic on “Data Sandboxes = Industrial Parks.”  
- **Angle:** Connect to economic development, job creation, and privacy debates.

## Recording & Editing Stack (Week 2/3)
- Reuse OBS scene variants per pillar (Science & Philosophy indigo, Tech & Society cyan, India’s Future saffron).  
- Voiceover strategy: block two scripts per day to avoid vocal fatigue, keep room tone library updated.  
- B-roll batching:  
  - Simulation topic: capture VR headset usage, code scroll (screen capture), cosmic visuals.  
  - Cognitive topic: film analog note-taking vs phone scrolling.  
  - Counterfactual topic: film maps, ship models, historical books.  
  - Data real estate: capture server rack visuals (Canva animation), local data center exterior shots (if accessible) or stock placeholders with attribution.  
- Editing template: duplicate Premiere project from Video 2, create sequences `V04_Simulation`, `V05_Dumber`, `V06_Reversed`, `V07_DataRealEstate`. Maintain color-coded markers for intro, act transitions, CTA.

## Thumbnail Batch Plan
| Video | Pillar | Dominant Color | Headline Options |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | Science & Philosophy | Deep Indigo | “Are We Simulated?” / “Proof We’re Code?” |
| 5 | Tech & Society | Electric Cyan | “Tech Is Shrinking Us” / “Brain vs Notifications” |
| 6 | India’s Future | Saffron | “If India Ruled London” / “Empire Reversed” |
| 7 | Tech & Society | Electric Cyan + Gold | “Data Is the New Land” / “Sell Your Pixels?” |

Run Canva batch export, ensure 320 × 180 previews, store in `/assets/thumbnails/batch-1/`.

## Efficiency Tracking
- Log actual hours per task in sheet with columns: `Video`, `Research`, `Writing`, `VO`, `Screen`, `Edit`, `Thumbnail`, `Metadata`.  
- After Week 3, compute averages; compare to Videos 1–3 baseline to validate 12–15 hour target.  
- Document process tweaks (e.g., script templating, batch grading LUT preset) in `docs/work/epic-2/analytics/batch-production-efficiency.md` placeholder (to be created after cycle).

## Risk & Mitigation
- **Voice Fatigue:** Maintain hydration, schedule rest day mid Week 2.  
- **Storage constraints:** Offload raw footage nightly to external SSD; mirror to cloud as bandwidth permits.  
- **Creative burnout:** Interleave script topics (simulation vs edtech) to keep variety.  
- **Policy changes:** Monitor DPDP Act, zero MDR updates during production; update scripts accordingly.

## Next Actions
1. Allocate dedicated research slots (2 hours each video) to populate note templates by Day 2 of Week 1.  
2. Draft full scripts by Day 5; book reviewer feedback for Simulation & Counterfactual episodes.  
3. Prepare OBS scene profiles and Canva template duplicates before Week 2 begins.  
4. Set calendar reminders for Week 4 publish schedule (Mon/Wed/Fri/Mon).
