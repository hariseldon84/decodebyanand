## Section 4: Technical Assumptions

This section documents technical decisions and assumptions that will guide the Architect in designing the content production system and workflow infrastructure.

**Note:** This is a YouTube channel project, so "technical assumptions" refers to production tools, content management systems, workflow automation, and supporting infrastructure rather than traditional software architecture.

---

### 4.1 Repository Structure

**Decision:** **Monorepo** (Single repository for all project assets)

**Rationale:**

- Content production involves tightly coupled assets (scripts, visuals, video files, thumbnails)
- Version control benefits from atomic commits across related files
- Simpler backup and recovery strategy
- Single source of truth for all project materials
- Easier to maintain consistency across videos

**Repository Organization:**

```

**Version Control:**

- Platform: Git + GitHub (or GitLab)
- Private repository (content is IP)
- Branching strategy: Simple main + feature branches for major projects
- Commit frequency: Daily (scripts, assets), per-video (final deliverables)

---

### 4.2 Content Production Architecture

**Decision:** **"Podcast-Style Monolith"** (Integrated production workflow, not microservices)

**Architecture Description:**

- Single-person, end-to-end production pipeline
- Research → Script → Record → Edit → Publish (sequential stages)
- Centralized content calendar and project management
- Modular templates for repeatability

**Rationale:**

- Solo creator model doesn't benefit from distributed systems
- Simplicity prioritized over scalability (initially)
- Faster iteration with fewer moving parts
- Can evolve to team-based model later without complete re-architecture

**Production Stages:**

1. **Research & Ideation**
   - Tools: Notion/Obsidian for research notes
   - Sources: Academic papers, books, credible journalism, expert interviews
   - Time allocation: 3-20 hours per video (varies by complexity)

2. **Scripting**
   - Tools: Google Docs or Markdown editor
   - Template-based structure (opening hook, main body, closing)
   - Version control in Git
   - Peer review (optional - trusted friend/colleague)

3. **Recording**
   - Audio: OBS Studio or Audacity (screen + voiceover)
   - Video: Screen recording (slides, diagrams, browser tabs)
   - Setup: Home studio (minimal equipment)
   - Duration: 2-3 takes per video (allows for mistakes)

4. **Editing**
   - Software: DaVinci Resolve (free) or Adobe Premiere Pro
   - Workflow: Rough cut → Fine cut → Color grading → Audio mixing → Export
   - Assets integration: B-roll, graphics, captions
   - Time allocation: 4-8 hours per video

5. **Publishing**
   - Platform: YouTube Studio (web + mobile app)
   - Scheduling: Upload 24-48 hours before publish time
   - Metadata: Title, description, tags, thumbnail, captions
   - Cross-posting: Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram (semi-automated)

**Scalability Considerations:**
- Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Solo production, 2-3 videos/week
- Phase 2 (Months 7-12): Consider part-time editor if revenue supports
- Phase 3 (Months 12+): Possible team expansion (researcher, editor, social media manager)

### 4.3 Testing Requirements

**Decision:** **Manual Quality Assurance** (No automated testing, human review at each stage)

**Testing Strategy:**

#### 1. Pre-Production Testing (Research Phase)

- Fact-checking: Verify all statistical claims with 3+ sources
- Source credibility: Evaluate source bias and reliability

- **Pass Criteria:** Script approved, sources documented

#### 3. Recording Quality Testing

- Audio test: Check levels (-16 to -20 LUFS), clarity, background noise
- Visual test: Screen recordings clear, no lag, proper resolution
- Performance test: Delivery natural, pacing appropriate
- **Pass Criteria:** Usable takes recorded, no technical glitches

#### 4. Editing Quality Testing

- Visual QA: Color grading consistent, graphics readable on mobile

- Thumbnail A/B: Two options prepared, strongest selected
- Compliance check: No copyright issues, community guidelines compliant
- Accessibility check: Captions accurate, contrast ratios sufficient
- **Pass Criteria:** All publishing checklist items completed

#### 6. Post-Publish Monitoring

- Performance monitoring: CTR, retention, engagement tracked
- Comment moderation: Respond to questions, address concerns

- Research database (sources, notes, citations)
- Production tracker (stage tracking, time logging)
- Analytics dashboard (performance metrics, insights)
- **Rationale:** Visual interface, flexible databases, collaboration-ready (if team grows)

#### 2. Git/GitHub (Asset Version Control)

- Scripts (Markdown files)
- Graphics (design files + exported assets)
- Metadata (titles, descriptions, tags)
